#### SDGs
14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
透過各漁業別之漁產量，以監測、管理各類型漁具漁法 (包括鏢旗魚、一支釣、曳繩釣、延繩釣、刺網、巾著網、焚寄網、圍網、扒網、魩鱙漁業、拖網、珊瑚漁業等) ，這些漁法，根據影響海洋生態的程度，可略分為永續性漁法、針對性漁法、破壞性漁法，為達到資源合理的開發與永續利用，應詳細追蹤各類漁法的變化趨勢。
### Definition and calculation
1. Fishery ladings( tons) for fishery categories of coastal fisheries
2. The current data is the total of inshore fishery production (thousand tons) and the value of output (thousand NTD) from annual fishery statistical report
### Updates
According to the 2018 Fisheries Statistics Annual Report, the total output of coastal fisheries was 161.53 thousand tons, with an output value of 13,210,104 thousand NTD; the total output of coastal fisheries was 26.39 thousand tons, with an output value of 3,605,905 thousand NTD.
