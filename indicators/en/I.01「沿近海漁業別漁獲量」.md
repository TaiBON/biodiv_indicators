#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Monitor and manage various types of fishing gear and fishing methods (including spear fishing, poles and lines boote, troll line, long line, gill net, purse seine, torch light net, purse seine, danish seine, larval anchovy fishery, drag net, reef fishery, etc.), these fishing methods can be divided into sustainable fishing methods, targeted fishing methods, and destructive fishing methods according to the degree of impact on the marine ecology. In order to achieve reasonable development and sustainable use of resources, the trends of changing in various fishing methods should be tracked in details.
### Definition and calculation
1. Fishery landings (tons) of diffrent offshore and inshore fishery categories
2. The current data are the cumulated sums of offshore fishery production (thousand tons), offshore fishery value (thousand NTD), inshore fishery production (thousand tons), and inshore fishery value (thousand NTD), from past years, provided by the Fishery Statistics Annual Report.
### Updates
According to the 2018 Fishery Statistics Annual Report, the total production of offshore fisheries was 161.53 thousand tons, with a value of 13,210,104 thousand NTD; the total inshore fisheries production was 26.39 thousand tons, with a value of 3,605,905 thousand NTD.
