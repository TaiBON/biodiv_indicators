### Brief description
The indicator analysis the fish landings of each fishery in order to monitor, manage and eliminate non-sustainable fishing gear and fishing methods (including spearfishing, pole-and-line, troll line, long line, gillnet, purse seine, torch light net, purse seine, danish seine, larval anchovy fishery, drag net, reef fishery, etc.) or to classified by the tonnage of fishing vessels. The sequence of the fishing methods and the tonnage of fishing vessels mentioned above suggests the impact on the marine ecology. The latter the methods or classifies are, the less conforming to the principle of sustainable utilization.

目標5 野生物種合理利用及貿易 確保野生物種的使用、採獵、交易和利用是可持續的、安全的、合法的，防​止​過​度​開​發，減少對非目標物種和生態系統的影響,減少病原體溢出的風險，採用生態系統方法，同時尊重和保護原住民和地方社區的可持續的習慣使用。 目標9 野生物種永續利用 確保永續管理和利用野生物種，從而為人民，特別是處境脆弱和最依賴生物多樣性的人提供社會、經濟和環境福利，包括通過可持續的生物多樣性活動，能增強多樣性的產品和服務，保護和鼓勵原住民和地方社區的生計和可持續的習慣使用。
#### 愛知目標(舊CBD目標)：
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Monitor and manage various types of fishing gear and fishing method (including spearfishing, pole-and-line, trolling, longline fishing, gillnet, purse seine, torchlight net, seine fishing, danish seine, larval anchovy fishery, trawling, reef fishery, etc.), these fishing methods can be divided into sustainable fishing methods, targeted fishing methods, and destructive fishing methods according to the degree of impact on the marine ecology. In order to achieve reasonable development and sustainable use of resources, the trends of change in various fishing methods should be tracked in detail.
### Definition and Calculation
1. Fish landings (tons) of diffrent offshore and inshore fishery categories
2. The current data are the cumulated sums of offshore fishery production (thousand tons), offshore fishery value (thousand NTD), inshore fishery production (thousand tons), and inshore fishery value (thousand NTD), from past years, provided by the Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook.
### Update
依據民國111年(2022)漁業統計年報，近海漁業產量合計115,325公噸，產值9,794,757千元；沿岸漁業產量合計19,863公噸，產值3,352,285千元。
