### Brief description
The indicator analysis the fish landings of each fishery in order to monitor, manage and eliminate non-sustainable fishing gear and fishing methods (including spearfishing, pole-and-line, troll line, long line, gillnet, purse seine, torch light net, purse seine, danish seine, larval anchovy fishery, drag net, reef fishery, etc.) or to classified by the tonnage of fishing vessels. The sequence of the fishing methods and the tonnage of fishing vessels mentioned above suggests the impact on the marine ecology. The latter the methods or classifies are, the less conforming to the principle of sustainable utilization.

#### SDGs
14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
#### Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
Goal 5: Sustainable Use and Trade of Wild Species. <br> Ensure that the use, harvestnig and trade of wild species are sustainable, safe and legal, prevent overexploitation, minimizing impacts on non-target species and ecosystems, and reducing the risk of pathogen spillover, applying the ecosystem approach, while respecting and protecting customary sustainable use by indigenous peoples and local communities. <br> Goal 9: Sustainable Use of Wild Species. <br> Ensure the management and use of wild species are sustainable, thereby providing social, economic and environmental benefits for people, especially those in vulnerable situations and those most dependent on biodiversity, including through sustainable biodiversity-based activities, products and services that enhance diversity, and protecting and encouraging customary sustainable use by indigenous people and local communities.
#### Aichi Target (Previous Version of the CBD Targets):
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Monitor and manage various types of fishing gear and fishing method (including spearfishing, pole-and-line, trolling, longline fishing, gillnet, purse seine, torchlight net, seine fishing, danish seine, larval anchovy fishery, trawling, reef fishery, etc.), these fishing methods can be divided into sustainable fishing methods, targeted fishing methods, and destructive fishing methods according to the degree of impact on the marine ecology. In order to achieve reasonable development and sustainable use of resources, the trends of change in various fishing methods should be tracked in detail.
### Definition and Calculation
1. Fish landings (tons) of diffrent offshore and inshore fishery categories
2. The current data are the cumulated sums of offshore fishery production (thousand tons), offshore fishery value (thousand NTD), inshore fishery production (thousand tons), and inshore fishery value (thousand NTD), from past years, provided by the Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook.
### Update
According to the Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook (2022), the total offshore fishery production was 115,325 metric tons, with a production value of NT$9,794,757 thousand; the total coastal fishery production was 19,863 metric tons, with a production value of NT$3,352,285 thousand.
