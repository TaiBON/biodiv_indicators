#### SDGs
14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Monitor and manage various types of fishing gear and fishing methods (including spear fishing, poles and lines boote, troll line, long line, gill net, purse seine, torch light net, purse seine, danish seine, larval anchovy fishery, drag net, reef fishery, etc.), these fishing methods can be divided into sustainable fishing methods, targeted fishing methods, and destructive fishing methods according to the degree of impact on the marine ecology. In order to achieve reasonable development and sustainable use of resources, we should track the changing trends of various fishing methods in detail.
### Definition and calculation
1. Fishery ladings (tons) for fishery categories of coastal fisheries
2. The current data is the total of inshore fishery production (thousand tons) and the value of output (thousand NTD) from annual fishery statistical report
### Updates
According to the 2018 Fisheries Statistics Annual Report, the total output of coastal fisheries was 161.53 thousand tons, with an output value of 13,210,104 thousand NTD; the total output of coastal fisheries was 26.39 thousand tons, with an output value of 3,605,905 thousand NTD.
