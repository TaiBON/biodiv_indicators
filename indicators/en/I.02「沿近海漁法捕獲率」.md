### Brief Description

Select several species representing each trophic level and calculate their catch per unit effort to understand and evaluate the changing trends of coastal fishery resources, formulate relevant fishery management measures, and hope to achieve reasonable resource development and sustainable utilization.

### Themes

Fishery resources

### PSBR Model Type

Status (S)

### Corresponding Targets

#### SDGs

14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels.

#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets

Target 6:
By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.

### Background

The ratio of the number of fish caught to the unit of effort is called Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE). However, due to the lack of unit-of-effort data, CPUE cannot be calculated. Instead, As a result, standardized fishing time based on VDR data was used, along with landing reports from various ports, to estimate the catch rate.

### Definition and Calculation

To estimate the catch rate, specific spatial and temporal parameters (e.g., region, year, month, day) and representative fishing gears/methods are first defined. VDR (Voyage Data Recorder) data are then used to calculate operation time by subtracting sailing time from total nautical operation time. This information is combined with reported catch data from various fishing gears and methods provided by each port to derive the catch rate.
