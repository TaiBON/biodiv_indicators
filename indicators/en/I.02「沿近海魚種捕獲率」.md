Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The ratio of "working time (effort)" to "yield of catch" is called yield of catch per unit effort (CPUE). However, there is no effort data available, therefore it is impossible to calculate the CPUE. As a result, VDR (voyage data recorder) data is used to standardize "working time" and in combination with the data from investigation reports of each port to estimate the "Catch Rate".
### Definition and Calculation
Voyage data recorder (VDR) data is calculated as nautical operation time－sailing time ＝ operation time, in combination with the capture data of various fishing gear and methods reported by each port, set the required area (space) and time (year, month, day) and representative of the fishing gear/methods estimates the catch rate.
