14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The ratio of "yield of catch" to "working time (effort)"is called Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE). However, there is no effort data available, therefore it is impossible to calculate the CPUE. As a result, VDR (voyage data recorder) data is used to standardize "working time" and in combination with the data from inspection reports of each port to estimate the "Catch Rate".
### Definition and Calculation
To estimate the catch rate, specific area (space), time (year, month, day), and representative fishing gears/methods are first set, then the data of VDR is used, which is calculated as nautical operation time－sailing time ＝ operation time, in combination with the capture data of various fishing gears and methods reported by each port.
