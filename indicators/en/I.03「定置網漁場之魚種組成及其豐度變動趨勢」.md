#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6 By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
A passive fishing method that can calculate the fishing effort without calibration mainly relies on taking advantage of the characteristic of highly migratory species along the coast. The net arrangement of the passive fishing method is putting the net on the fish passage and setting like a maze, which blocks the way of fish to get in or out. There are currently about 15 fishing grounds and 63 sets of nets in the coastal region around Taiwan, and Yilan and Hualien are in majority. The target fish are skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), Mackerel tuna (Auxis thazard), ribbon fish (Trichiurus lepturus), and Common dolphifish (Coryphaena hippurus).
### Definition and Calculation
Fish composition and its abundance change trends of fishing ground of set net
1. Collecting long-term catch data from set net fishery around Taiwan.
2. Selecting five dominant species and calculating their temporal change of the yield of catch (kg), the number of individuals, and the diversity index.
