### Brief description
The spatial-temporal variations of the catch composition and abundance of the set net fisheries in the offshore waters around Taiwan could be one of the important indicators of the changes in the offshore epipelagic fishery resources.

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Set net fishing is a passive fishing method whose fishing effort can be calculated without complicated calibration. It takes advantage of the characteristic of highly migratory species along the coast: nets are set up on the necessary returning passage of the fish and the arrangement looks like a maze, which blocks the way of fish to get out once they are in the net maze. Currently, there are approximately 15 fishing grounds and 63 sets of nets in the coastal region around Taiwan, mainly in the Yilan and Hualien areas. The target fishes are skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*), bullet tuna (*Auxis rochei*), Mackerel tuna (*Auxis thazard*), ribbon fish (*Trichiurus lepturus*), and Common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*).
### Definition and calculation
Variation trends of fish composition and abundance in the set-net fishing grounds
1. Collect long-term catch data from set-net fisheries around Taiwan.
2. Select five dominant species and calculate their temporal change in the yield of catch (kg), the number of individuals, and the diversity index.
### Updates
Current data is updated to 2017. The yeilds of catch of target fish species are: skipjack tuna 805.037 tons, bullet tuna 347.013 tons, mackerel tuna 520.592 tons, ribbon fish 268.813 tons, and common dolphinfish 238.112 tons.
