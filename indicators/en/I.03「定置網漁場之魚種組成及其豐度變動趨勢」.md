### Brief description
The spatial-temporal variations of the catch composition and abundance of the set net fisheries in the offshore waters around Taiwan could be one of the important indicators of the changes in the offshore epipelagic fishery resources.

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.4.1 Resource management of economic fish species in offshore and coastal waters.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Set net fishing is a passive fishing method whose fishing effort can be calculated without complicated calibration. It takes advantage of the characteristic of highly migratory species along the coast: nets are set up on the necessary returning passage of the fish and the arrangement looks like a maze, which blocks the way of fish to get out once they are in the net maze. Currently, there are approximately 15 fishing grounds and 63 sets of nets in the coastal region around Taiwan, mainly in the Yilan and Hualien areas. The target fishes are skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*), bullet tuna (*Auxis rochei*), Mackerel tuna (*Auxis thazard*), ribbon fish (*Trichiurus lepturus*), and Common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*).
### Definition and calculation
Variation trends of fish composition and abundance in the set-net fishry grounds
1. Collect long-term catch data from set-net fishery grounds around Taiwan.
2. Select five dominant species and calculate their temporal change in the yield of catch (kg), the number of individuals, and the diversity index.
### Updates
According to the 2019 fixed net fishery statistics provided by Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, there were skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) 633,713.7 kg, bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) 241,267.6 kg, frigate tuna (Auxis thazard) 270,647.1 kg, beltfish (Trichiurus lepturus) 491,966 kg, and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) 893,459.4 kg.
