### Brief description
The Mean Trophic Index can be used to monitor whether there is excessive fishing pressure in inshore/offshore area of Taiwan, resulting in a rising proportion of low-trophic-level consumers in the catch.

#### SDGs
14.2.2 Mean Trophic Level (MTL) and Fishing in Balance Index (FiB) Quantitative target for 2020: MTL and FiB values are maintained at the current level, and the data for constructing the index will be collected to compile Taiwan’s own MTL and FiB indicators.
#### Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
Ensure that areas under agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry are managed sustainably, in particular through the sustainable use of biodiversity, including through a substantial increase of the application of biodiversity friendly practices, such as sustainable intensification, agroecological and other innovative approaches, contributing to the resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6 By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Because commercial fishing tends to collectively and systematically catch the top level consumers in the marine food web (tunas, cods, groupers), when the marine ecosystem is under pressure from overfishing and its resilience is undermined, it is expected to see the ratio of top level consumers would decline and the ratio of low level consumers would arise, which is called "fishing down marine food webs". This indicator is used to monitor if the aforementioned phenomenon appears in the inshore and offshore waters of Taiwan.
### Definition and Calculation
Take the relative abundance of each marine organisms caught in the water of Taiwan in a certain year as the weight of the trophic level (fish landing of a certain species/total fish landing). By multiplying the weight and trophic level of a certain species, then adding up all the results of multiplying, the "mean trophic level" of a specific year is obtained. The annual change of the mean trophic level will reflect the status of the monitored organisms. If the number is declining, it may imply that the top level consumers in the marine ecosystem of a country are facing overfishing. This is defined as the mean trophic index.
### Updates
The data source is the Region-based Marine Trophic Index of the catch in the waters of Taiwan in Sea Around Us. The previous data was until 2014, and it has been updated to 2016. Taiwan’s average nutritional index (MTI) in 2016 was 3.72.
