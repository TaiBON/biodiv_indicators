14.2.2 平均營養位階(MTL)及漁獲平衡指數(FiB) 2020年量化目標：MTL值及FiB值維持現有水準，另蒐集建構指數編制資料，俾自行編制我國之MTL及FiB指標。
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6 By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Because commercial fishing tends to collectively and systematically catch the secondary or tertiary consumers in the marine food web (mackerels, cods, groupers), these top level consumers ratio would decline and low level consumers ratio would arise as expected when the marine ecosystem is under pressure from overfishing and its resilience is undermined, which is called "fishing down marine food webs." This index is used to monitor the possible phenomenon in coastal and offshore waters of Taiwan.
### Definition and Calculation
以臺灣沿近海漁獲中各海洋生物於特定年度之相對豐度為其營養位階之權數，各自相乘並加總後，得特定年度的平均營養位階，並以此數值的年度變化反映監測對象狀態。如數值趨勢變化為遞減，可能暗示一個國家海洋生態系中的高階消費者正面臨過漁壓力，此即平均營養指數
