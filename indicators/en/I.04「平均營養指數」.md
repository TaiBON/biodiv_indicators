#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6 By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Because commercial fishing tends to collectively and systematically catch the secondary or tertiary consumers in the marine food web (mackerels, cods, groupers), these top level consumers ratio would decline and low level consumers ratio would arise as expected when the marine ecosystem is under pressure from overfishing and its resilience is undermined, which is called "fishing down marine food webs." This index is used to monitor the possible phenomenon in coastal and offshore waters of Taiwan.
### Definition and Calculation
Take the relative abundance of Taiwan coastal marine organisms in a certain year as the weight of the trophic level. By multiplying each of the trophic level weight and summing them up, the average trophic level of the specific year is obtained. The annual change of the average trophic level will reflect the status of the monitored organisms. If the numerical trend is decreasing, it may imply that the tertiary consumers in a marine ecosystem of a country are facing overfishing, which is the mean trophic index.
### Updates
The data until 2014 is from the Region-based Marine Trophic Index of the catch in the waters of Taiwan in Sea Around Us.
