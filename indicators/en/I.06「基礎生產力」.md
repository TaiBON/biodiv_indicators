14.2 Ensure the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 6 By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The size of the marine primary production is the basic parameter for evaluating the productivity of fisheries in a sea area. In terms of practical application, we compare the primary production obtained from the actual measurement and the primary production required to sustain fisheries (PPR) calculated from Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook, to explore whether there has been over-fishing in Taiwan’s fishing grounds.
### Definition and Calculation

$$ PPR=(Catches/9)\times10^{n-1} $$

The Fisheries Research Institute attached to Council of Agriculture conducts long-term monitoring on the concentration of chlorophyll a(Chl-a) in 62 fixed measuring stations in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The monitoring method is to collect water samples from the aforementioned 62 stations on a seasonal basis, and the water samples were filtered using 10 μm sieve cloths and 0.7 μm filter membranes sequentially. After filtering the phytoplankton, the used membranes are stored in -20℃ and away from light. Then the membranes are brought back to the laboratory, and extracted with 90% acetone at low temperature for 14-24 hours, then the fluorescence value is measured before and after acidification with a fluorometer to calculate the Chl-a content in the sea.
### Information update content
There was no corresponding data in the past. The current data is based on the chlorophyll a concentrations measured in a long-term monitoring program at the 62 stations in the surrounding marine areas of Taiwan by the Fisheries Research Institute, Council of Agriculture.
