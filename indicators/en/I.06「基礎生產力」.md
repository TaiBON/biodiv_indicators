### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.2 Ensure the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 6 By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The size of the marine primary productivity is the basic parameter for evaluating the productivity of a sea area’s fisheries. In terms of practical application, we compare the primary productivity obtained from the actual measurement and the primary production required to sustain fisheries (PPR) calculated from annual fishery report, and to explore whether there has been over-fishing in Taiwan’s fishing grounds.
### Definition and Calculation

$$ PPR=(Catches/9)\times10^{n-1} $$

農委會水產試驗所在台灣周邊海域固定62個測站長期監測葉綠素a濃度，其調查方法為於臺灣周邊海域62測站按季採集水樣，葉綠素甲 (Chl-a) 分別使用10 μm篩絹及0.7 μm濾膜，逐級過濾浮游植物後遮光冷凍 (-20℃) 保存攜回實驗室，將濾後濾膜經90%丙酮低溫萃取 14-24 小時後，以螢光光度計測定酸化前後的螢光值，計算出海域中葉綠素甲含量。
### Updates
There was no corresponding data in the past. The current data is based on the long-term monitoring cholorphyll-a concentrations at the 62 stations in the surronding marine areas of Taiwan by the Fisheries Research Institute, Council of Agriculture.
