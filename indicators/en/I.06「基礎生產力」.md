### Brief description
The size of the marine primary productivity is the basic parameter for evaluating the productivity of fisheries in a sea area. In terms of practical application, we compare the primary productivity obtained from the actual measurement with the primary productivity and primary productivity (PPR) required to sustain fisheries calculated from Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook, to explore whether there has been over-fishing in Taiwan’s fishing grounds.

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.2 Ensure the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The size of the marine primary productivity is the basic parameter for evaluating the productivity of fisheries in a sea area. In terms of practical application, we compare the primary productivity obtained from the actual measurement with the primary productivity and primary productivity (PPR) required to sustain fisheries calculated from Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook, to explore whether there has been over-fishing in Taiwan’s fishing grounds.
### Definition and Calculation

$$ PPR=(Catches/9)\times10^{n-1} $$

The Fisheries Research Institute attached to Council of Agriculture conducts long-term monitoring on the concentration of chlorophyll a(Chl-a) in 62 fixed measuring stations in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The monitoring method is to collect water samples from the aforementioned 62 stations on a seasonal basis, and the water samples were filtered using 10 μm sieve cloths and 0.7 μm filter membranes sequentially. After filtering the phytoplankton, the used membranes are stored in -20℃ and away from light. Then the membranes are brought back to the laboratory, and extracted with 90% acetone at low temperature for 14-24 hours, then the fluorescence value is measured before and after acidification with a fluorometer to calculate the Chl-a content in the sea.
### Update
There was no corresponding data in the past. The current data is based on the long-term monitoring of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in 62 fixed measuring stations in the waters surrounding Taiwan. Based on the total chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration data greater than and less than 10 μm, the sea area on the east side of Taiwan in 2019  is 0.089 mg/m3, and the sea area on the west side is 0.159 mg/m3.
