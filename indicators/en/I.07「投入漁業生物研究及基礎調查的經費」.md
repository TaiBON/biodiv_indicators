### Brief description
Fundamental research on fishery biology of specific fish species, or resource assessment of specific fish species and fishery methods is an important basis for fishery resource management, and (data from these research/assessment) is needed when providing Taiwan's quota of fish landing which is an requirement for participation in Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Therefore fishery biological research and fundamental surveys should be continuously funded.
### Themes
Fishery resources
### PSBR model type
Response (R)
### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Fundamental research on fishery biology of specific fish species, or resource assessment of specific fish species and fishery methods is an important basis for fishery resource management, and (data from these research/assessment) is needed when providing Taiwan's quota of fish landing which is an requirement for participation in Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Therefore fishery biological research and fundamental surveys should be continuously funded. In addition to biological research, port investigators, voyage recorders, and follow-up tracking of fingerling release are also parts of fundamental research.
