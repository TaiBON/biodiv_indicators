### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Fundamental research on fishery biology of specific fish species, or resource assessment of specific fish species and fishery methods is an important basis for fishery resource management, and it is also required to provide fishing quota for Taiwanâ€™s participation in Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Therefore it should be continuously invested in budget of fisheries biological research and fundamental investigations. In addition to biological research, any mention of port investigators, voyage recorders, and follow-up tracking of fingerling release is also part of fundamental research.
