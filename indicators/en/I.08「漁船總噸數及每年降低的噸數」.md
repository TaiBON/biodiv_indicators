#### SDGs
14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The total tonnage of fishing vessels and the reduction in tonnage each year can reflect the fishing capacity of fishery. This indicator is the response type in the Psbr model of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership. Overfishing should be one of the major reasons for the reduction of fishery resources, and how to reduce the fishing pressure should establish management and incentive measures to reduce the number of fishing vessels and tonnage. The gross tonnage of a country’s fishing vessels can represent the country’s fishing capacity to a certain extent. This indicator should be viewed in conjunction with the index of the total number of effective fishing vessels, in order to avoid the operation of combined small ships.
### Definition and Calculation
The number of vessels and tonnages with legal licenses issued by Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture
### Updates
According to the fishery statistics annual report of 2018, th total tonnage of powered fishing vessels was 571,040.57 tons, which was 9,514.12 tons lower than 2017.
