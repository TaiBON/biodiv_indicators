### Brief description
Overfishing should be one of the main reasons for the reduction of fishery resources. To alleviate the pressure of overfishing, management and incentive measures should be established to reduce the number of fishing vessels and tonnage. This biodiversity indicator is the number of the tonnage of fishing vessels by year. For the number of vessels, please refer to[Fishing Vessels by Year](/zh-hant/indicator/psbr/161) and Horsepowers in [ Fishing Vessels by Year ](zh-hant/indicator/psbr/162).

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.4 Effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 6: By 2020, based on the maintenance of the ecosystem, all aquatic resources such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic plants can be managed and harvested in a sustainable and legal manner to avoid overfishing. In addition, the restoration plans and measures for targeted depleted fish species would be implemented, and the impact of fishing on threatened fish stocks and fragile ecosystems would be contained within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The total tonnage of fishing vessels and the reduced tonnage each year can reflect the fishing capacity of fishery. This indicator is the Response type in the PSBR model of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership. Overfishing should be one of the major reasons for the reduction of fishery resources, and establishing management and incentive measures to reduce the number of fishing vessels and tonnage could alleviate the pressure of overfishing. The total tonnage of a country’s fishing vessels can represent the country’s fishing capacity to a certain extent. This indicator should be viewed in conjunction with the indicator of the total number of active fishing vessels, in order to avoid (missleading interpretation due to) the operation of combined small ships.
### Definition and Calculation

### Updates
依據民國108年(2019)漁業統計年報，動力漁船總噸數為554,040,55噸，較前一年降低17,000.02噸。
