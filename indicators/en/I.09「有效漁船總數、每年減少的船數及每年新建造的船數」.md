### Corresponding targets
14.4 Effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 6 By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Overfishing should be one of the major reasons for the reduction of fishery resources, and establishing management and incentive measures to reduce the number of fishing vessels and tonnage could alleviate the pressure of overfishing. Since many fishing vessels are not actually engaged in fishing activities or are inactive, it is necessary to estimate the total number of active fishing vessels and the number of vessels reduced each year using the registered logbook of fishing vessels going to sea or the VDR records of the port inspection office (hope the numbers is reducing each year). Usually, each year, the tonnage of newly-built fishing vessels must be smaller than that of the replaced fishing vessels, but the newly-built ones have significantly increased fishing efficiency, therefore the statistics of the newly built vessels will be an important indicator.
### Definition and Calculation
The number of vessels with legal licenses, in the database of legal fishing vessels issued by the Fisheries Agency
### Updates
According to the Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook 2018, the total number of powered fishing boats was 12,173, which was 180 fewer than that in the year of 2017.
