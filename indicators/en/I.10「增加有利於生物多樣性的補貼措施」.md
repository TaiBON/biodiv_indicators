### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.6.1 Subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities will not be granted.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 4 By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well within safe ecological limits.
### Background
The trend of various subsidies over the years can be used as a reference for the revision of fishery policy. Increasing positive subsidies (that is conducive to biodiversity) will help the restoration of fishery resources.
### Definition and Calculation
1. Whether some of the fishery subsidies are positive or negative is still controversial. The subsidies for gas used and incentives for fishing moratorium account for the majority.
2. The data of the positive subsides indicator adopts the subsidy amount per year for fishing moratorium.
3. The data of subsidies for fishing moratorium comes from the final accounts of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture and its affiliated units, which is part of the central government’s final accounts, in units of thousand NTD.
### Updates
According to the final accounts of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture in 2019, the amount of subsidies for fishing moratorium is 360,470 thousand NT dollars, much higher than the fishing moratorium subsidies in 2009-2018. The possible reason is that the Council of Agriculture released the "Regulations for Rewards of Voluntary Fishing Suspense" on June 21, 2019, encouraging fishermen to work in the peak season and suspend fishing in off-peak season.
