### Brief description
Eliminating the negative subsidies that are not conducive to biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries, or increasing favorable positive subsidies, will help the restoration of fishery resources. This work has been included in the UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 and Aichi Goal 3. Therefore, governments of all countries need to actively review and improve the effectiveness of fishery subsidy policies in maintaining fishery resources.
### Themes
Fishery resources
### PSBR model type
Response (R)
### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.6.1 Subsidies for illegal, unreported, and unregulated (iuu) fishing activities will not be granted.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 4 By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well within safe ecological limits.
### Background
Tracking the trend of various subsidies over years can be a reference for the revision of fishery policy. At present, relevant subsidies, such as subsidies for gas and fishing moratoriums, especially gas subsidies, account for almost 50% of the budget of Fisheries Agency. The cancellation of adverse subsidies that are not conducive to biodiversity or the sustainability of fisheries will help restore fishery resources.
### Definition and Calculation
1. Whether some of the fishery subsidies are beneficial or adverse is still controversial. The majority of the subsidies are for gas and incentives for fishing moratorium.
2. The gas subsidy data comes from the annual expenditure plan summary and branch plan summary table in the statutory budget of the Fisheries Agency, and the unit is 1,000 yuan.
3. 本項指標檢討時認為，油價變動會影響每年實際補貼的用油量，故應修正改以補貼的用油量會較符合實際狀況。但因漁業統計年報中僅有用油補貼金額，並無補助之用油量；且補助金額係用「以歸墊油品公司代墊之甲種、乙種及丙種漁船油優惠油價補貼款，並補貼漁業人漁船用汽油優惠油價差額」，無法推估各種漁船用油量，故在資料上同時以補助金額及發油量呈現指標趨勢。
### Updates
依據漁業署法定預算中之歲出計畫提要及分支計畫概況表，民國108年(2019)用油補貼獎補助費為1,320,134千元。 依據漁業署來函之資料，民國108年 (2019) 發油量為54.3萬公秉。
