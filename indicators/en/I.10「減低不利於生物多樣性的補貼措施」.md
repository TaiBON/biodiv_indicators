# I.10 "Reducing Subsidies Not Conducive to Biodiversity"

Original indicator name: a subsidy measure that is not conducive to biodiversity and reduce the negative impact

### Brief description

Eliminating subsidies detrimental to biodiversity and sustainable fisheries, or increasing beneficial ones, will help restore fishery resources.This initiative is incorporated in United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14, Aichi Target 3, and Target 18 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Accordingly, governments worldwide should actively review and enhance the effectiveness of fishery subsidy policies in sustaining fishery resources.

### Themes

Fishery resources

### PSBR Model Type

Response (R)

### Corresponding Targets

#### SDGs

14.6.1
Subsidies for illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities will not be granted.

#### Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework

By 2025, and eliminate, phase out or reform incentives, including subsidies, harmful for
biodiversity, in a proportionate, just, fair, effective and equitable way, while substantially and progressively reducing them by at least $500 billion per yearby 2030, starting with the most harmful incentives, and scale up positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets

Target 4 By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well within safe ecological limits.

### Background

Tracking the trends of various subsidy amounts over the years can provide a reference for revising fisheries policies.Currently, relevant subsidies such as fuel subsidies and fishing moratorium incentives account for almost 50% of the Fisheries Agency's budget, especially fuel subsidies.Removing subsidies that harm biodiversity and sustainable fisheries will help restore fishery resources.

### Definition and Calculation

1. There is still debate over whether certain fishery subsidies are positive or negative, with fuel subsidies and fishing moratorium incentives accounting for the majority.
2. The fuel subsidy data are sourced from the Fisheries Agency's annual expenditure program summary and subprogram overview tables, with units in thousands of NTD.
3. When reviewing this indicator, it was noted that changes in fuel prices would affect the actual amount of subsidized fuel each year. Therefore, it was recommended to revise the indicator to use the volume of subsidized fuel consumption, which better reflects the actual situation.However, the Taiwan Fisheries Yearbook only report the amount of feul subsidy without providing the volume subsidized feul. In addition, the subsidy amount is described as "The subsidy refers to the amount advanced by fuel companies to cover the preferential fuel prices for Class A, B, and C fishing vessels, and includes the reimbursement of the price difference between the discounted and actual market prices of gasoline used by fishers." Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the fuel amount used by various fishing boats. As a result, the subsidy amount is used to show the trend of the indicator.

### Updates

According to the annual expenditure program summary and subprogram overview table in the statutory budget of the Fisheries Agency, the feul subsidy in the 2018 was NT$1,159,950,000.
