### Background

The trend of various subsidies over the years can be used as a reference for the revision of fishery policy. Increasing positive subsidies that is conducive to biodiversity will help the restoration of fishery resources.

### Definition and Calculation

1. There is still debate over whether certain fishery subsidies are positive or negative, with fuel subsidies and fishing moratorium incentives accounting for the majority.
2. The annual amount of subsidies for the fishing moratorium was used as the indicator for positive subsidies.
3. Data on fishing moratorium subsidies were obtained from the fiscal final accounts of the Fisheries Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and its affiliated units, as part of the central government’s final accounts, The unit is in thousand NTD.

### Updates

According to the 2019 fiscal final account of the Fisheries Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, the amount of subsidies for the fishing moratorium was NT$360.47 million.Compared to the years 2009–2018, the amount of subsidies for the fishing moratorium in 2019 was significantly higher. This may be attributed to the “Regulations for the Incentive Program for Voluntary Fishing Moratorium” announced by the Council of Agriculture (now the Ministry of Agriculture) on June 21, 2019, which encouraged fishers to concentrate their operations during peak periods of fishery resource abundance and to suspend fishing during off-peak periods.
