### Brief description
Marine Protected Area (MPA) is conceptually a protected oceans, seas, estuary or large lake area. It usually restricts human activities in a specific form to protect the natural or cultural resources. The ratio of Marine Protected Areas to the sea areas adjacent to Taiwan is an important sustainability indicator.

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas. Quantitative target for 2020: Marine Protected Areas accounts for 47.8% of Taiwan's marine area within 12-nautical mile.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
By 2020, at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative, and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascapes.
### Background
Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are protected areas of oceans, seas, estuaries, or great lake regions whose natural or cultural resources are usually protected through restricting human activities in a specific form. The definition of Marine Protected Areas of Taiwanese government, according to the official website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, is “areas within a certain range of the average high-water mark extending to the sea, with special natural landscapes, important cultural heritages, and sustainable ecological resources, etc., which must be protected and managed by law or other effective ways"
### Definition and Calculation
1. There are many legal sources for Taiwan's marine protected areas, and the degree of protection is also different. The scope of the calculation (for example, only include the most protected Marine Protected Areas) must be specified before sum up the eligible Marine Protected Areas and deduct the overlapping areas.
2. 因臺灣的國際地位特殊，目前無法公告200浬經濟海域面積，如依過去計算以12浬領海面積做為計算分母，與國際無法比較。109年9月4日本計畫舉辦之專家諮詢會議，建議修正此項指標僅以面積和數量表示，暫不考慮分母計算的問題。
### Updates
依據海保署提供資料，目前(2020) 共45處海洋保護區，面積5264.0933平方公里(不含漁具漁法禁漁區) 。
### Data Management Authorities
Ocean Conservation Administration, Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, National Park Headquarters, Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Tourism Bureau, and Ministry of the Interior.
