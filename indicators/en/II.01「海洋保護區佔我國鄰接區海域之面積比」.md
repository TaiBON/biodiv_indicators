### Brief description
Marine Protected Area (MPA) is conceptually a protected oceans, seas, estuary or large lake area. It usually restricts human activities in a specific form to protect the natural or cultural resources. The ratio of Marine Protected Areas to the sea areas adjacent to Taiwan is an important sustainability indicator.

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5.1 The proportion of Marine Protected Areas in Taiwan's marine areas. Quantitative target for 2020: Marine Protected Areas accounts for 47.8% of Taiwan's marine area within 12-nautical mile.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
By 2020, at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative, and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascapes.
### Background
Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are protected areas of oceans, seas, estuaries, or great lake regions whose natural or cultural resources are usually protected through restricting human activities in a specific form. The definition of Marine Protected Areas of Taiwanese government, according to the official website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, is “areas within a certain range of the average high-water mark extending to the sea, with special natural landscapes, important cultural heritages, and sustainable ecological resources, etc., which must be protected and managed by law or other effective ways"
### Definition and Calculation
1. There are many legal sources for Taiwan's marine protected areas, and the degree of protection is also different. The scope of the calculation (for example, only include the most protected Marine Protected Areas) must be specified before sum up the eligible Marine Protected Areas and deduct the overlapping areas.
2. Due to the special international status of Taiwan, it is not possible to publish the area of the economic sea area within 200 nautical miles. If using the territorial waters within 12 nautical miles as the denominator, it is not comparable with data from other countries. The conclusion of a meeting held at the Ocean Conservation Administration on November 19, 2019 suggested that the denominator should be changed to contiguous zone, from the territorial sea which includes internal waters.
3. There is still no data of the contiguous zone, therefore the Trends presented is the cumulative areas of Marine Protected Areas (km^2^).
### Updates
According to the information on the website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, as of the end of December 2018, the total area of Taiwan’s Marine Protected Areas (excluding areas for certain fishing gear and fishing method, and specific fishery prohibited areas), was 4495.5276 km^2^, and the Marine Protected Areas accounted for 6.908% of the total water area (the area of internal waters within 12 nautical mile of Taiwan offshore is 65,076.96 km^2^).
### Data Management Authorities
Ocean Conservation Administration, Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, National Park Headquarters, Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Tourism Bureau, and Ministry of the Interior.
