#### SDGs
14.5.1 海洋保護區面積占我國海洋區域的比例。 2020年量化目標：海洋保護區面積占我國12浬海洋區域之比例為47.8%。
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Marine protected area (MPA) is a protected area of oceans, seas, estuaries, or great lake regions, and usually restricts human activities in a specific form to protect the natural or cultural resources. The definition of Marine protected areas of Taiwanese government according to the official website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture is “within a certain range of the average high water line extending to the ocean, with special natural landscapes, important cultural heritage, and sustainable ecological resources, etc., must be governed by law or other effective ways to protect and manage the area."
### Definition and Calculation
1. There are many legal sources for Marine protected areas of Taiwan, and the strictness of protection to different areas is also different. The scope of the calculation (for example, only the most protected marine protected areas) must be specified and deduct the overlapping parts before the total area of eligible marine protected areas is added.
2. Due to the special international status of Taiwan, it is not possible to announce the area of the 200-mile economic sea area. If using the 12-mile territorial sea area as the denominator, it will not able to compare with other countries. The conclusion of a meeting held at the Ocean Conservation Administration on November 19, 108 suggested that the denominator should be changed to the contiguous zone.
3. There is still no data of the contiguous zone, the data unit presented by the current trend is the cumulative area of marine protected areas (km^2^).
### Updates
According to the information on the website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, the total area of Taiwan’s marine protected areas (excluding relevant fishing gear and fishing methods and specific fishery prohibited areas) as of the end of December 2018 was 4495.5276 km^2^, and the marine protected areas accounted for 6.908% of the total water area (Taiwan offshore The water area within 12 miles is 65,076.96 km^2^).
