### Brief description
Marine Protected Area (MPA) is conceptually a protected oceans, seas, estuary or large lake area. It usually restricts human activities in a specific form to protect the natural or cultural resources. The ratio of Marine Protected Areas to the sea areas adjacent to Taiwan is an important sustainability indicator.

#### SDGs
14.5.1 The proportion of marine protected areas in national marine areas. 2020 Quantitative Target: area of marine protected areas accounts for 47.8% of 12-mile marine areas.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Marine Protected Area (MPA) is conceptually a protected oceans, seas, estuary or large lake area. It usually restricts human activities in a specific form to protect the natural or cultural resources. According to the announcement on the official website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, the definition of Marine Protected Area is “An area extending seaward from mean high tide line to a certain range, with special natural features, important cultural heritage and sustainable use of ecological resources, protected by law or other effective means.”
### Definition and Calculation
1. There are many legal sources for Taiwan's marine protected areas, and the degree of protection is also different. The scope of the calculation (for example, only include the most protected Marine Protected Areas) must be specified before sum up the eligible Marine Protected Areas and deduct the overlapping areas.
2. Due to Taiwan’s special international status, it is currently not possible to announce the area of the 200-mile exclusive economic zone. If the denominator of the 12-mile territorial sea is used as the denominator in the past calculation, it cannot be compared with internationally.On September 4, 2020, the expert consultation meeting held by the project suggested to amend this indicator to be expressed in terms of area and quantity only, without considering the denominator calculation for the time being.
### Updates
According to the information on the website of the Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, as of 2020, there are 45 Marine Protected Areas, and the total area of Taiwan’s Marine Protected Areas (excluding areas for certain fishing gear and fishing method, and specific fishery prohibited areas), was 5264.0933 km^2.
