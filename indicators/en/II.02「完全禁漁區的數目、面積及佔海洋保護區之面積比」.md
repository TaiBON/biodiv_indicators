### Brief description
Planning marine protected areas (including fishing exclusion zone), improving implement of management and bans are the simplest and most effective ways to restore fish resources. Therefore, by 2020, the global goal is to have 10% of the oceans included in the scope of Marine Protected Areas. When calculating the area ratio, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is mostly used as the denominator in other countries, while Taiwan uses areas within 12 nautical miles which includes internal water as the denominator.

#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Planning marine protected areas (including fishing exclusion zone), improving implement of management and bans are the simplest and most effective ways to restore fish resources. Therefore, by 2020, the global goal is to have 10% of the oceans included in the scope of Marine Protected Areas. When calculating the area ratio, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is mostly used as the denominator in other countries, while Taiwan uses areas within 12 nautical miles which includes internal water as the denominator.
### Definition and Calculation
"Fishing exclusion zone", commonly referred as " no-take area" in other countries, is equivalent to "core area" or "marine reservation area," where no fishing gear or method of any kind is allowed to enter. In Taiwan, areas with restrictions on any fishing gear, fishing method, or fish species are called "no-fishing zone " Therefore, the term "fishing exclusion zone" is used to avoid confusion. To calculate this index, add up the areas of all eligible fishing exclusion zone (or core area of the marine protected area), deduct the overlapping areas, and divide it by the total marine protected area.
### Updates
According to the information on the website of Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, as of the end of December 2018, the total area of marine protected areas prohibited from entering or being affected was 586.2332 km^2^, accounting for 1.8942% of the total area of existing marine protected areas; the total area of marine protected areas prohibited from harvesting is 2974.7439 km^2^, accounting for 9.6116% of the total area of the existing marine protected areas. According to the data provided by Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture in 2020, each marine protected area has different zoning management. A total of 20 marine protected areas are designated as no-entry or no-harvesting areas. The total area is 3566.9189 square kilometers, accounting for 67.75% of the area of the marine protected area. (Excluding forbidden fishing zone).
### Trends
Based on the data announced on the website of Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture in 2018 and the data provided by the Ocean Conservation Administration, there is still needs to clarify the calculation basis, so it is not possible to draw the indicator trend for the time being.
### Data Management Authorities
Ocean Conservation Administration, Fisheries Agency, National Park Headquarters, Forestry Bureau, Tourism Bureau, and Ministry of the Interior.
