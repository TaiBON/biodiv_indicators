### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 Protecting at least 10% of coastal and marine areas.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Planning marine protected areas (including completely prohibited fishing areas), improving management and increasing bans are the simplest and most effective ways to restore fish resources. Therefore, by 2020, there should be 10% of the oceans included in the scope of marine protected areas in the global goal. When calculating the area ratio, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is mostly used as the denominator in foreign countries, while our country uses 12 nautical miles with internal water as the denominator.
### Definition and Calculation
No-take area, which is equivalent to "core area" or "marine reserve region," is not allow fishing gear or method to enter. In Taiwan, if a region contains any fishing gear, fishing method, or fish species restrictions, it can also be called a "no-fishing zone." Therefore, the term "no-take area" is used to avoid confusion. The ratio of no-take area to the marine protected area is getting the sum of no-take area, deducting the overlapping parts, and dividing it by the total protected area.
### Updates
依據漁業署網站資料，至2018年12月底，禁止進入或影響之海洋保護區總面積為586.2332 km^2^，佔現有海洋保護區總面積比例為1.8942%；禁止採捕之海洋保護區總面積為2974.7439 km^2^，佔現有海洋保護區總面積比例為9.6116%。
### Trends
依漁業署網站之公告2018年資料為基準，因無過去資料無法畫出指標趨勢圖。
