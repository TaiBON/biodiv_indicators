### Brief description
Planning marine protected areas (including fishing exclusion zone), improving implement of management and bans are the simplest and most effective ways to restore fish resources. Therefore, by 2020, the global goal is to have 10% of the oceans included in the scope of Marine Protected Areas. When calculating the area ratio, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is mostly used as the denominator in other countries, while Taiwan uses areas within 12 nautical miles which includes internal water as the denominator.

#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Planning marine protected areas (including fishing exclusion zone), improving implement of management and bans are the simplest and most effective ways to restore fish resources. Therefore, by 2020, the global goal is to have 10% of the oceans included in the scope of Marine Protected Areas. When calculating the area ratio, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is mostly used as the denominator in other countries, while Taiwan uses areas within 12 nautical miles which includes internal water as the denominator.
### Definition and Calculation
"Fishing exclusion zone", commonly referred as " no-take area" in other countries, is equivalent to "core area" or "marine reservation area," where no fishing gear or method of any kind is allowed to enter. In Taiwan, areas with restrictions on any fishing gear, fishing method, or fish species are called "no-fishing zone " Therefore, the term "fishing exclusion zone" is used to avoid confusion. To calculate this index, add up the areas of all eligible fishing exclusion zone (or core area of the marine protected area), deduct the overlapping areas, and divide it by the total marine protected area.
### Updates
依據漁業署網站資料，至2018年12月底，禁止進入或影響之海洋保護區總面積為586.2332 km^2^，佔現有海洋保護區總面積比例為1.8942%；禁止採捕之海洋保護區總面積為2974.7439 km^2^，佔現有海洋保護區總面積比例為9.6116%。 依據海保署提供之2020資料，各海洋保護區分區劃設管理不同，共20處海洋保護區劃設為禁止進入分區或禁止採捕區域，面積合計3566.9189平方公里，佔海洋保護區面積比為67.75% (不含漁具漁網禁漁區)。
### Trends
依漁業署網站之公告2018年資料，以及海保署所提供之資料，因需釐清其計算基準，故暫無法畫出指標趨勢圖。
