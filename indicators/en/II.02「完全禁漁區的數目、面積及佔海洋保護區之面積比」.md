### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 Protecting at least 10% of coastal and marine areas.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Planning marine protected areas (including completely prohibited fishing areas), improving management and increasing bans are the simplest and most effective ways to restore fish resources. Therefore, by 2020, there should be 10% of the oceans included in the scope of marine protected areas in the global goal. When calculating the area ratio, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is mostly used as the denominator in foreign countries, while our country uses 12 nautical miles with internal water as the denominator.
### Definition and Calculation
No-take area, which is equivalent to "core area" or "marine reserve region," is not allow fishing gear or method to enter. In Taiwan, if a region contains any fishing gear, fishing method, or fish species restrictions, it can also be called a "no-fishing zone." Therefore, the term "no-take area" is used to avoid confusion. The ratio of no-take area to the marine protected area is getting the sum of no-take area, deducting the overlapping parts, and dividing it by the total protected area.
### Updates
According to the website of the Fisheries Agency, as of the end of December 2018, the total area of marine protected areas that are prohibited from entering or being affected is 586.2332 km^2^, accounting for 1.8942% of the total area of existing marine protected areas; the total area of marine protected areas prohibited from harvesting It is 2974.7439 km^2^, accounting for 9.6116% of the total area of existing marine protected areas.
### Trends
Based on the 2018 data published on the Fisheries Agency's website, the indicator trend chart cannot be drawn due to no past data.
