#### SDGs
14.2 在西元 2020 年以前，以可永續的方式管理及保護海洋與海岸生態，避免重大的不利影響，作法包括強健他們的災後復原能力，並採取復原動作，以實現健康又具有生產力的海洋。
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
The sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, algae reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, lagoons, hot springs, cold springs are of important ecological functions and values, which can reflect the changes of the ocean and coast, should be clearly divided its area and monitored for a long time.
### Definition and Calculation
The sum of the area and quantity of important and sensitive marine ecosystems (including coral reefs, algal reefs, sea grass beds, mangroves, lagoons, hot springs, cold springs, etc.)
### Updates
In 2019, a research of seagrass distribution in the intertidal zone on the west coast of Taiwan's main island, Penghu and Kinmen had found 36.8 hectares of seagrass beds. The result of the research showed that the total area of seagrass beds was 36.8 hectares. Also, the area of mangrove forests in 2019 was 660.7 hectares, after adding the area of islet regions, it would become 680.7 hectares.
