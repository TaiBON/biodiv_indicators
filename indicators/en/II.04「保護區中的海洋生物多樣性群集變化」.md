#### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
1. The management of marine protected areas (MPA) must be implemented to allow the establishment of MPA to be effective. The most fundamental method to evaluate whether the MPA are effectively managed is to monitor important biomes (such as fish, corals, seagrass, and zooplanktons) at certain sites of the MPA on a regular basis. Surveying the trend of species structure changes in a community can reflect the changes of biodiversity in the MPA.
2. At present, "Marine Protected Areas" are based on several different legal sources whose laws and regulations, protection targets, goals, funding and manpower are all different. (It is still under debate that) whether different unit should set corresponding indicators for management on long-term monitoring methods to evaluate its management performance.
### Definition and Calculation
1. Select protected areas established by different laws and regulations, set up fixed survey stations or lines, and monitor changes in their community indicators (species composition, abundance and diversity index).
2. The Reef Check in Marine National Park Headquarters and Kenting National Park Headquarter has more than 10 years of data, which can be used as indicator data first.
### Updates
Currently, only the coral coverage rate of Dongsha Atoll provided by the Marine National Park Headquarters is available. The coral coverage rate in the reefs in the lagoon, the outer side of the south reef platform, and the east of Dongsha Island were: 30.6%, 80.6%, and 68.1% respectively in 2018; and 68%, 80.6%, and 58.8% in 2019.
