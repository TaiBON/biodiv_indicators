### Brief description
If we only focus on the monitoring plan in the protected area, we may not be able to understand the actual changes in fishery resources and marine life in the ocean. For more than 90% of Taiwan’s coastal marine organisms that are not fully protected, monitoring the long-term changes in species number, numbers of individuals in each species, and species composition, and comparing them with the data of protected areas can highlight the importance of marine protected areas.

#### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
If we only focus on the monitoring plan in the protected area, we may not be able to understand the actual changes in fishery resources and marine life in the ocean. For more than 90% of Taiwan’s coastal marine organisms that are not fully protected, monitoring the long-term changes in species number, numbers of individuals in each species, and species composition, and comparing them with the data of protected areas can highlight the importance of marine protected areas.
### Definition and Calculation
Among the marine environmental and ecological impact evaluations (mainly the environmental evaluations on constructions in sea area) that are still monitoring continuously, the data from the monitoring stations that have accumulated more than 3 to 5 years are selected. We collect, sort, and analyze the data on species community (e. g., plankton, fish &their juveniles, benthic organisms, and cetaceans, etc.) to understand the dynamic changes of marine biodiversity and fishery resources in most inshore and offshore unprotected areas of Taiwan. If detailed information is available on certain species, we calculate its abundance and biodiversity index.
### Update
Recommended data source： (1) Long-term monitoring data of Taipower published by assistant professor, Hungyen Chen. (2) The ReefCheck data with EcoDiver system.
