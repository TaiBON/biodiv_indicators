### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
(Increasing) the manpower and intensity for law enforcement, as well as fundings invested, can improve the effectiveness of management on marine protected areas. The participation of communities or stakeholders in the operation and management of marine protected areas is essential to the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, the authorities and responsible agencies should reinforce their mechanisms for encouragement to participate and increase incentive measures.
### Definition and Calculation
Count the investment of law enforcement funds and the number of voyages for law enforcement in marine protected areas over the years (regardless of whether there are violations of regulations found during those voyages)
