### 指標對應
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### 發展背景
In the past, the methods to manage protected areas were all controlled by the government, but the international conservation society began to have alternative reflections and thinkings. People in local communities were re-recognized as the main stakeholders of the protected areas and expected to be included in the management mechanisms. This is the so-called participatory managementof protected areas. The research published in Modern Biology in 2006 even pointed out that many governmental departments failed to designate marine protected areas. The size of the marine protected areas is not the reason, but the actual participation of local communities in the management of protected areas is the key to success in protection.
### 定義及計算方式
Tally the results of community participation in patrols in marine protected areas over the years (number of participants and patrols)
