### Brief description
1. Law enforcement manpower and intensity, as well as funding investment, can improve the management effectiveness of marine protected areas.
2. The participation of communities or rights holders in the operation and management of marine protected areas is an important key to the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, the authorities and responsible agencies should encourage their participation in mechanisms and incentive measures.

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
In the past, the methods to manage protected areas were all controlled by the government, but the international conservation society began to have alternative reflections and thinkings. People in local communities were re-recognized as the main stakeholders of the protected areas and expected to be included in the management mechanisms. This is the so-called participatory managementof protected areas. The research published in Modern Biology in 2006 even pointed out that many governmental departments failed to designate marine protected areas. The size of the marine protected areas is not the reason, but the actual participation of local communities in the management of protected areas is the key to success in protection.
### Definition and Calculation
Tally the results of community participation in patrols in marine protected areas over the years (number of participants and patrols)
### Update
According to the website of Fisheries Agency, Council of Agriculture, the 2018 patrol results of the private patrol teams in the marine protected areas: the number of patrol participants is 91, the total number of shifts is 2022, the total number of shift hour is 11,869 hours, and the number of conservation volunteers is 100. Based on the information provided by the Ocean Conservation Administration, there are currently 11 marine protected areas with patrol participants, accounting for 24.4% of all marine protected area in 2020.
