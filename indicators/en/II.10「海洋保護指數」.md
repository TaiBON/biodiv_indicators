# II.10 "Marine Protected Area Index"

### Brief Description
The Marine Protected Areas (MPA) index focuses on classifying and quantifying the management level of protected areas, and helps to access the intensity of different types of fishing activities.

### Themes
Marine protected areas
### PSBR model type

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
The Marine Protected Area Index (MPA index) was proposed by Horta e Costa et al. in 2016. This index focuses on how to classify and quantify the intensity of management on rotected area. It has not yet been developed and calculated in Taiwan.
### Definition and Calculation
The "Marine Protected Area Index" is different from the traditional IUCN classification system of six major types. The protected area is divided into eight levels of zones (ZONE Classification):
1. No-take/no-go
2. No-take/regulated access
3. No-take/unregulated access
4. Highly regulated extraction
5. Moderately regulated extraction
6. Weakly regulated extraction
7. Very weakly regulated extraction
8. Unregulated extraction

The method of 1-8 level determination. A decision tree is used to distinguish and grade, and four aspects were taken into consideration: type of fishing gear and method, the index for aquaculture or bottom exploitation, the index for use of recreational fishing method, whether or not fishing boat can enter and anchor. There are detailed scoring standards for each aspect. $$ I_{MPA}=\sum_{z=1}^{n_z}C_{z_i}\times\frac{A_{z_i}}{A_{MPA}} $$ $I_{MPA}= $MPA index $C_{z_i}=$ level of the i-th zone $A_{z_i}=$ area of the i-th zone $A_{MPA}= total area of $MPA
