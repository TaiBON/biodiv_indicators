# II.10 "Marine Protected Area Index"

### 內容簡述
海洋保護區指數（MPA index）著重在如何對保護區管理的強度予以分級與量化，可協助判斷漁業各項活動的強度情況。

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
The Marine Protected Area Index (MPA index) was proposed by Horta e Costa et al. in 2016. This index focuses on how to classify and quantify the intensity of management on rotected area. It has not yet been developed and calculated in Taiwan.
### Definition and Calculation
The "Marine Protected Area Index" is different from the traditional IUCN classification system of six major types. The protected area is divided into eight levels of zones (ZONE Classification):
1. 禁漁/禁入（no-take/no-go）
2. 禁漁/管制進入（no-take/regulated access）
3. 禁漁/未管制進入（no-take/unregulated access）
4. 高度監管的漁撈（Highly regulated extraction）
5. 中度監管的漁撈（Moderately regulated extraction）
6. 低度監管的漁撈（Weakly  regulated extraction）
7. 非常低度監管的漁撈（very weakly regulated extraction）
8. 未管理的漁撈（unregulated extraction）

The method of 1-8 level determination. A decision tree is used to distinguish and grade, and four aspects were taken into consideration: type of fishing gear and method, the index for aquaculture or bottom exploitation, the index for use of recreational fishing method, whether or not fishing boat can enter and anchor. There are detailed scoring standards for each aspect. $$ I_{MPA}=\sum_{z=1}^{n_z}C_{z_i}\times\frac{A_{z_i}}{A_{MPA}} $$ $I_{MPA}= $MPA index $C_{z_i}=$ level of the i-th zone $A_{z_i}=$ area of the i-th zone $A_{MPA}= total area of $MPA
