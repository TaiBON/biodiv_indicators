### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, algae reefs, sea grass beds, mangroves, lagoons, hot springs, cold springs are of important ecological functions and values. They are indicators that can reflect the changes of the ocean and coast, and their areas should be clearly divided and monitored on a long-term basis.
### Definition and Calculation
The total area of the mangrove ecosystems in the surrounding waters of Taiwan.
### Updates
The surveyed area of mangrove forest in 2019 is 660.7 hectares, and the total area reaches 680.7 hectares if the offshore islands are added.
