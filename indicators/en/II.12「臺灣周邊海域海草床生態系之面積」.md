# II.12「臺灣周邊海域海草床生態系之面積」

### 內容簡述
海草床敏感生態系極具重要生態功能與價值，能反映海洋與海岸變遷之指標，應清楚劃分其面積大小並長期監測面積變化。

### Themes
Marine protected areas
### PSBR model type
State (S)
### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, algae reefs, sea grass beds, mangroves, lagoons, hot springs, cold springs are of important ecological functions and values. They are indicators that can reflect the changes of the ocean and coast, and their areas should be clearly divided and monitored on a long-term basis.
### Definition and Calculation
The total area of the seagrass beds in the surrounding waters of Taiwan.
### Updates
The survey of seagrass distribution in the intertidal zone of Taiwan's west coast, Penghu and Kinmen will be completed in 2019, with a total area of 36.8 hectares of seagrass beds in the inventory.
