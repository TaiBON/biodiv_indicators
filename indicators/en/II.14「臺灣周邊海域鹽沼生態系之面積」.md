# II.14 Area of Salt Marsh Ecosystem in Waters Around Taiwan

### Brief Description
The establishment of marine protected areas must be accompanied by effective management in order to achieve their intended outcomes. The most fundamental approach to assess whether MPAs are effectively managed is to conduct regular and site-specific monitoring of key biological groups within the MPA, tracking trends in community species composition and structure over time.This indicator reflects changes in the biodiversity of salt marsh ecosystems in the waters surrounding Taiwan.

### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, algae reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, lagoons, hot springs, cold springs are of important ecological functions and values. They are indicators that can reflect the changes of the ocean and coast, and their areas should be clearly divided and monitored on a long-term basis.
### Definition and Calculation
The total area of the salt marsh ecosystem in the surrounding waters of Taiwan.
