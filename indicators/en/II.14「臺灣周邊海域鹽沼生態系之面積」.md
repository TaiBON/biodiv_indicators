# II.14「臺灣周邊海域鹽沼生態系之面積」

### 內容簡述
劃設海洋保護區必須落實管理才能發揮成效，評估海洋保護區是否有效管理最根本的評估辦法，是在海洋保護區內定期、定點進行重要生物類群的監測，調查物種群聚結構變化趨勢。本指標反映臺灣週遭海域之鹽沼生態系生物多樣性之變化。

### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, algae reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, lagoons, hot springs, cold springs are of important ecological functions and values. They are indicators that can reflect the changes of the ocean and coast, and their areas should be clearly divided and monitored on a long-term basis.
### Definition and Calculation
The total area of the salt marsh ecosystem in the surrounding waters of Taiwan.
