# II.15 Investing in the Management of Marine Protected Areas

### Brief Description
Investing in manpower, material resources, and funding for research, monitoring, enforcement, and public education and outreach is essential to obtain sufficient scientific data to demonstrate the effectiveness of marine protected areas. These data will help industry, government, academia, fishers, and the general public understand the importance of MPAs, thereby increasing their willingness to support the designation and effective management of such areas.

### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11 By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Investing in manpower, material resources, and funding for research, monitoring, enforcement, and public education and outreach is essential to obtain sufficient scientific data to demonstrate the effectiveness of marine protected areas. These data will help industry, government, academia, fishers, and the general public understand the importance of MPAs, thereby increasing their willingness to support the designation and effective management of such areas, particularly community-based management, and fostering greater public awareness and compliance with relevant regulations.
### Definition and Calculation
The annual budgets allocated by relevant ministries and councils to enhance the effectiveness of marine protected area management, including funding for research, monitoring, enforcement, and education and outreach efforts.
### Updates
The Ocean Conservation Administration invested a total of NT$1.5 million in commissioned and subsidized projects related to the survey and monitoring of marine protected areas in 2019 and 2020. However, there are no available statistics on related funding from other central or local government agencies. In 2020, the enforcement of marine protected areas was carried out by the Coast Guard Administration, Fisheries Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Park Police Corps, and the local governments. However, since these enforcement efforts also cover other management duties, it is difficult to distinguish the portion of budget specifically allocated to marine protected area. In 2020, education and outreach efforts related to marine protected areas were carried out separately by central and local government agencies. However, since these efforts also encompassed other aspects of marine conservation, it is difficult to distinguish the portion of the budget specifically allocated to marine protected areas.
