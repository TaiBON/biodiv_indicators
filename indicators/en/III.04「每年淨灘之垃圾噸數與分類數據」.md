State (S)
### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. 14.1.1 Index of coastal eutrophication and floating plastic debris density. 2020 Quantitative target: Taiwan Marine Debris Action Plan is tentatively scheduled for 2018â€“2022. Continue promoting "On-going Action Plan" and execute "Future Plan" of Taiwan Marine Debris Action Plan to effectively reduce debris and impact on marine environment.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 8 By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
### Background
Marine debris (or marine litter) is commonly defined as "any object that has been discarded, disposed of, or inadvertently abandoned, and enters the coast or marine environment." Marine garbage may come from land and sea. The sources or terrestrial debris include landfills, river entrainment, sewage drainage system spills, industrial wastes, and coastal recreational activities, etc.; those from the sea include ship goods, cruise channels, discarded fishing gear from fishing vessels, discarded debris of warships and research vessels, offshore natural gas and petroleum exploitation facilities, aquaculture facilities, etc. From the point of view of the distribution location, it can be subdivided into seafloor marine debris (SMD), floating marine debris (FMD) and beach debris (BMD). As humans inhabitat intensively in coastal areas, coupled with the increasingly active maritime shipping and fishing activities, the amount of marine debris has been accumulated over the years, and has become increasingly large. It even gathers at sea into island-like drifts, extending as long as 500 nautical miles, and dubbed as "plastic soup", its harm is increasing day by day, and it has become a problem that we should work hard to face.
### Definition and Calculation
1. The tonnage of garbage collected during beach cleaning and sea cleaning at specific beaches and marine areas every year or quarter will be recorded, as well as the classification data recorded in the International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) action, standardized by the proportion of plastic waste in total garbage.
2. The past status of the development of this indicator data is Iii, which means there is no data on this indicator to present the indicator trend. The current website of the Ocean Conservation Administration integrates the Coastal Beach Cleaning Adoption System of the Environmental Protection Agency of the Executive Yuan, the results of the sea cleaning operations carried out by the county and city governments, and the historical beach cleaning records of the The Society of Wilderness of Taiwan, which can be used as the data for this indicator; but the frequency of beach cleaning activities, the number of participants, the number of hours, etc., resulting in the inability to standardize the data, which still needs improvement in the future.
### Updates
According to the information on the website of the Ocean Conservation Administration, the total weight of beach-cleaning garbage in 2018 was 115,578.975 kg, and the number of beach-cleaning garbage was 181,480.
