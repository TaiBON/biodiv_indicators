14.3 Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets:
Target 10 By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification are minimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning.
### Background
Ocean acidification is thought to have a series of undesirable consequences, such as inhibiting the metabolism of invertebrate organisms, reducing the ability of marine organisms to form carbonated shells, and accelerating coral bleaching. As the saturation level of calcium carbonate in seawater decreases, it's becoming more and more difficult and in some cases impossible for animals with carbonated shells such as zooplankton, crustaceans, shellfish, corals, echinoderms and other invertebrates to form shells; and the calcium carbonate shells that have been formed could dissolve. In addition, the acidified ocean is also a threat to the marine food chain. When the zooplankton disappears, consumers at all levels of the food chain will disappear, and the marine ecosystem will face collapse and disintegration. Therefore, ocean acidification has become one of the most concerned issues of the global marine community, and all countries are making every effort to strengthen related survey and research. Taiwan is located in a hot zone for marine life in the world, not only because its habitats are diverse, but also because it accounts for one-tenth of the total number of species in the world. Therefore, Taiwan is the most ideal place to study the impact of ocean acidification and acidification on marine life.
