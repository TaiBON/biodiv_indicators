### 內容簡述
海洋酸化被認為具有一系列不良的後果，比如抑制了無脊椎生物新陳代謝、降低海洋生物形成碳酸殼體的能力，以及加速珊瑚白化。具碳酸殼體動物如浮游動物、甲殼類、貝介類、珊瑚、棘皮動物等無脊椎動物，會因海水碳酸鈣飽和值下降，變得越來越難甚至無法形成介殼，已形成的鈣質也易溶解。此外，正在酸化的海洋對海洋食物鏈也是一個威脅，當浮游動物消失之後，食物鏈上層的各級消費者也會隨之消失，海洋生態系將面臨崩潰和瓦解。因此海洋酸化已成為全球海洋界最關切的議題之一，各國無不傾全力在加強調查研究。

臺灣因位處於全球海洋生物的熱區，不但棲地多樣化，海洋生物物種數也佔全球總種數的十分之一，因此是研究海洋酸化、酸化對海洋生物影響最理想的地點。

### Background
Ocean acidification is thought to have a series of undesirable consequences, such as inhibiting the metabolism of invertebrate organisms, reducing the ability of marine organisms to form carbonated shells, and accelerating coral bleaching. As the saturation level of calcium carbonate in seawater decreases, it's becoming more and more difficult and in some cases impossible for animals with carbonated shells such as zooplankton, crustaceans, shellfish, corals, echinoderms and other invertebrates to form shells; and the calcium carbonate shells that have been formed could dissolve. In addition, the acidified ocean is also a threat to the marine food chain. When the zooplankton disappears, consumers at all levels of the food chain will disappear, and the marine ecosystem will face collapse and disintegration. Therefore, ocean acidification has become one of the most concerned issues of the global marine community, and all countries are making every effort to strengthen related survey and research. Taiwan is located in a hot zone for marine life in the world, not only because its habitats are diverse, but also because it accounts for one-tenth of the total number of species in the world. Therefore, Taiwan is the most ideal place to study the impact of ocean acidification and acidification on marine life.
