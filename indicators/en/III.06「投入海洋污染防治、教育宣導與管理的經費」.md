### Brief description
Marine pollution is becoming more and more serious. To provide the public with a healthy marine environment, it requires the government and private units to invest manpower, material resources, and funds for cleanup, prevention, research, etc.
### Themes
Marine pollution
### PSBR model type
Response (R)
### Corresponding targets
14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 8 By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
### Background
The prevention and control of marine pollution often require high costs and tremendous manpower. For example, in 2001, the Greek freighter Armas ran aground (on the coast of Taiwan). A total of 21,560 people including the national army and CNPC personnel participated in the rescue, and it took half a year to complete. Therefore, funds and manpower should be invested to strengthen the promotion and education of marine pollution prevention and control, so that the public can understand the seriousness of marine pollution, and then support the implementation and management of marine pollution prevention and control; we can also enhance the public's concept of law-abiding, and strengthen relevant emergency response drills, in order to quickly respond to pollution and reduce damage to the environment.
### Definition and Calculation
Count the annual funds invested in sea area and port monitoring, and the number of continuous and real-time automatic water quality monitoring equipment or systems that are set up each year, including the cost of new equipments and maintenance
### Update
海保署辦理衛星遙測、油污模擬、海污訓練、資訊系統管理等事項，108年度投入1,358萬元，109年度投入1622.5萬元。 地方政府投入海洋污染防治、教育宣導與管理之經費，因該項經費包含海洋廢棄物、海洋污染防治、地方海域水質監測、地方自辦世界海洋日及相關教育宣導等，難以區分。
