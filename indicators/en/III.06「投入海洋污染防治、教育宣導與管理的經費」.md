#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 8 By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
### Background
The prevention and control of marine pollution often require high costs and tremendous manpower. For example, in 2001, the Greek freighter Armas ran aground (on the coast of Taiwan). A total of 21,560 people including the national army and CNPC personnel participated in the rescue, and it took half a year to complete. Therefore, funds and manpower should be invested to strengthen the promotion and education of marine pollution prevention and control, so that the public can understand the seriousness of marine pollution, and then support the implementation and management of marine pollution prevention and control; we can also enhance the public's concept of law-abiding, and strengthen relevant emergency response drills, in order to quickly respond to pollution and reduce its damage to the environment.
