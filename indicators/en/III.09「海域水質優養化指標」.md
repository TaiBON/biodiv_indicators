# III.09 "Marine Water Quality and Eutrophication Indicator"

### Brief Description
The water quality index (WQI) is a method that integrates multiple water quality monitoring data into a single indicator. This indicator is calculated based on the eutrophication index (EI) developed from the assessments of coastal eutrophication. The indicator include five parameters: concentration of chlorophyll-a of phytoplankton, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and phosphate. <iframe src="https://TaiBON.github.io/biodiv_indicators/III.09%20海域水質優養化指標_dashboard.html" width="100%" height="2500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Corresponding Targets
####
14.1 <br> By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.<br> 14.1.2 <br> 2020 quantitative target: maintain more than 99.5% of the water quality data reaching the standards in 8 of the testing items.<br>
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 8 <br> By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
### Background
The water quality index (WQI) is a method that integrates multiple water quality monitoring data into a single indicator. WQI has been developed for 40 years. The first widely adopted general-purpose index was proposed by Brown et al. (1970), who select 9 parameters from an initial set of 35 through expert surveys and assigned weights (Wi) based on their relative importance. This became the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) in the United States. <br> The nine parameters used in the NSF-WQI are dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform, pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, temperature, turbidity, and total solids (TS). In Taiwan, scientist have refined the index and developed versions such as WQI8 and WQI5 to better reflect the characteristic of local water pollution.<br> However, under current regulations, the regular marine water quality monitoring programs in Taiwan do not include all the parameters required for any of these indices. Some of the necessary measurements are part of river water monitoring rather than marine water quality programs.
### Definition and Calculation
The nine parameters used in the NSF-WQI are dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform, pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, temperature, turbidity, and total solids (TS). In Taiwan, scientist have also proposed various WQI verisons; however, the sepecific set of water quality parameters to be used for the WQI has yet to be determined.<br>
