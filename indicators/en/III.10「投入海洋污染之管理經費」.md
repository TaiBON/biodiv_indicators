# III.10 Investment in the Management of Marine Pollution

### Brief Description

Investing funds and manpower in education and outreach on marine pollution prevention can enhance public awareness of the severity of marine pollution, thereby fostering greater support the implementation of related management measures. This also strengthens civic awareness of legal compliance and improves emergency response practices, enabling faster pollution mitigation and alleviating the resulting environmental damage.

### Corresponding Targets

#### SDGs

14.1<br> Reduce marine pollution of all kinds, including nutrients
and marine waste pollutions.<br>

#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets

Target 8 <br>
By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.

### Background

Marine pollution prevention often requires a substantial amount of financial and human resources. For example, the clean-up and salvage project following the grounding of Greek-registered cargo ship MV Amorgos in 2001 involved the mobilization of 21560 personnel from the military and CPC Corporation, and took nearly six months to complete.Therefore, it is necessary to invest funds and manpower in education and outreach on marine pollution prevention, to enhance public awareness of the severity of marine pollution, thereby fostering greater support for the implementation of related management measures. This also strengthens civic awareness of legal compliance and improves emergency response practices, enabling faster pollution mitigation and alleviating the resulting environmental damage.

### Definition and Calculation

Summarize the annual management costs related to marine pollution monitoring and prevention, including equipment and instrument expenses (and their maintenance), education and outreach programs, and training for marine pollution emergency response.

### Updates

Ocean Conservation Administration conducted satellite remote sensing, oil spill simulation, marine pollution mitigation training, and information system management. The allocated budget amounted to NT$13.58 million in 2019 and NT$16.23 million in 2020.
海保署109年預算650.4萬元。No automated continuous monitoring system has been implemented. A total of 138 monitoring sites have been established, including 105 marine sites, 12 sites at 6 landfills, 18 sites at 6 beaches, and 3 sites within 1 offshore wind turbine area.
The funds invested by local governments cover not only marine pollution prevention, education, outreach, and management, but also include expenditure related to marine debris cleanup, water quality monitoring in local wates, and the organization of World Oceans Day events and related educational activities. As these categories often overlap, it is diffcult to clearly distinguish how the funds are allocated.
