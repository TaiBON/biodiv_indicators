#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 12 By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
### Background
The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, *Sousa chinensis*, also known as the Matsu fish, inhabits the western coastal waters of Taiwan. Its current population is estimated to be fewer than 100 individuals. The Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, has announced the designation of an “Important Wildlife Habitat for Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin,” noting that the main threats come from declining food availability, habitats loss, marine pollution, underwater noise, and incidental bycatch from gillnet fisheries.
### Definition and Calculation
Within the distribution range of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, regular fixed transect surveys are conducted across different water depth gradients to record environmental variables and human activity factors, aiming to track changes in spatial distribution and habitat utilization. In hotspot marine areas, passive acoustic monitoring is applied to supplement data during periods without visual observation—such as nighttime and the autumn to spring seasons—to capture variations in temporal and spatial occurrence and abundance. Individual dolphins are identified using photo-identification, and population estimation methods are employed to monitor changes in key population parameters, including the number of individuals and mother-calf pairs
### Updates
According to the monitoring report by Professor Lien-Siang Chou’s team at National Taiwan University, 51 individual Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins were sighted in 2018. Based on the 2019 project report commissioned by the Ocean Conservation Administration, a total of 47 individual dolphins were identified from 25 sightings recorded in 2020. Data on the number of individuals from 2008 to 2018 are based on Chou et al. (2019), while the 2019 data are drawn from Bai et al. (2019). Sighting rate data for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin are adopted from the literature summary compiled by Bai et al. (2019).
