### Background
Green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) belong to the Cheloniidae family. They are medium/large-sized sea turtles and migrate to the sea area near their birthplace to mate during the breeding season. When the eggs mature, the female turtle lays her eggs on the beach where the temperature is higher than 25℃. The average hatching period is 45-55 days, and the success rate is about 70%. Currently, six beaches in Taiwan where they lay eggs have been protected as wildlife sanctuaries. The research team from National Taiwan Ocean University collected 24 and 19 years of green sea turtle's reproductive ecology data on Wang-an Island in Penghu County and Orchid Island in Taitung County, respectively. According to the corresponding 19-year data from both islands, they found that the difference (between the two islands) in the changes in the number of spawning female turtles may relate to fishery hunting on the high seas (if continuous monitoring has been done). Other possible causes and global climate changes are further studied to determine whether they affect the spawning population. These results are of great significance to academic research and the establishment of relevant government policies.
### Definition and Calculation
每年產卵季高峰期間 (6-9 月)，前往各產卵地進行長期駐島調查，除了計算上岸母龜數外，也記錄相關龜卵與稚龜形質資訊，並利用衛星發報定位器了解母龜的洄游模式及覓食區位置
