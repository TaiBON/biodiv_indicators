### Brief Description

Marine flagship species, umbrella species, endangered species, and economically important species play profound ecological roles and should therefore be prioritized for monitoring and conservation.

### Themes

#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets

Target 12 <br>By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.

### Background

The green sea turtle, belonging to the Cheloniidae family, is a medium- to large-sized marine turtle species. During the reproductive season, individuals return to the waters near their natal areas to mate. When the eggs mature, females come ashore to lay them on beaches where the temperature exceeds 25°C.The hatchlings emerge after approximately 45 to 55 days of incubation, with a hatching success rate of around 70%.Currently, six nesting beaches have been designated as wildlife protected areas.
A research team from National Taiwan Ocean University collected reproductive ecological data on green sea turtles for 24 years in Wang’an Island (Penghu County) and 19 years in Lanyu Island (Taitung County). By analyzing 19 years of corresponding data from both islands, the team found differences in the number of nesting females, which may be related to fishing activities in the high seas. 將可能的原因及全球氣候變遷，判斷是否對產卵族群會產生影響。These findings hold significant implications not only for academic research but also for government policy-making.

### Definition and Calculation

During the peak of the nesting season each year (June to September), long-term on-site surveys are conducted on the nesting islands of green sea turtle. In addition to counting the number of nesting females, data on eggs and hatchlings are also collected. Satellite transmitters are used to study the migratory behavior and foraging grounds of the female turtles

### Updates

According to the 2019 project reports commissioned by the Ocean Conservation Administration, which synthesized from published papers, government surveys and news articles, the population trends of nesting sea turtles remain unclear due to imcomplete data from most nesting sites, except for Wangan and Lanyu.Based on literature reviewed and interviews conducted, no records or reports of sea turtle nesting were found on Wangan Island.
According to the "2012 Project Report on the Population Ecology Survey and Protected Area Management of Green Sea Turtles in Penghu County", commissioned by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries of Penghu County Government, the nesting female turtles amounts between 2 in 1999 and 19 in 1998, the laying season concentrating in the July and August.
