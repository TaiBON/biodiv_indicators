Target 12 By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
### Background
Due to the Kuroshio Current, the east coast of Taiwan has become a fishing ground and attracted whales and dolphins for food. The amount and types of fish, shrimp, shellfish, and plankton as their food resource have to be sufficient to maintain a large cetacean population because the cetaceans and dolphins are usually the highest consumers in the food chain of local seas. Therefore, it can be said that the population of cetaceans and dolphins are closely related to the health of the ocean. There are 27 species of cetaceans and dolphins in Taiwan, accounting for about one-third of the 81 species in the world. Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, listed all cetaceans species as protected wild animals in accordance with the 	Wildlife Conservation Act, 1995, and established the Marine Animal Rescue Network (MARN). However, it is still affected by some human activities such as whale watching, pollution, improper fishing methods, and illegal spearfishing.
### Definition and Calculation
1. With cooperation between Kuroshio Ocean Education Foundation and the whale and dolphin watching industry, they've held ocean guides training course each year to educate visitors on the boats, and also investigate and keep track of the sightings of cetaceans in coastal and offshore waters.
2. The most frequent species were chose to present the individual variation, including Grampus griseus (Risso's Dolphin), Stenella longirostris (spinner dolphin), Stenella attenuata (pantropical spotted dolphin), Lagenodelphis hosei (Fraser's dolphin), Tursiops truncatus (Common bottlenose dolphin).
