### Brief Description
Protected areas provide multiple benefits for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Certain protected areas, such as national parks and nature reserves, allow applications for entry into the core area. By regulating the number of applicants, visitor activities can be reasonably managed while promoting the development of ecotourism within protected areas.

### Themes
Terrestrial protected areas
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Background
Protected areas provide various benefits to both biodiversity and sustainable development. Establishing protected areas is a globally recognized main strategy to protect species and ecosystems. Ecological zone (i.e., core zone) is the core of the protected areas, which contains important natural and cultural landscapes or habitats for species. The main purpose of establishing protected areas is to protect and preserve natural resources, landscapes, or important species, nonetheless, to allow people to visit nature as a way of education, parts of the protected areas such as national parks and natural reserves would accept applications for entering the core zone. With control over the number of applicants, the authorities can manage tour activities and promote eco-tour in the protected areas.
### Definition and Calculation
Count the number of people applying to enter protected areas every year as an indicator of the degree of human disturbance.
### Updates
From January to December 2021, 73,049 applications were received for entry into 30 wildlife refuges, nature reserves, and nature conservation areas.
### Trends
From 2015 to 2019, the number of visits to protected areas was generally higher than in 2014 and remained relatively stable. In 2020, a significant increase in visits was observed, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have led people to seek outdoor areas with fewer crowds. However, since the applicant quota varies across protected zones and the purposes of entry applications were not recorded, this trend is for reference only.<br> (under improvement; not yet disclosed)
