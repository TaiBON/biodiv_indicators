### 內容簡述
劃設「沿海保護區」主要是為了保護區域內部重要資源。該指標的建立旨在於進行各項建設計畫時，如土地開發、疏濬排水等是否會影響保護區內的生態環境。

### Themes
Terrestrial protected areas
### PSBR model type
State (S)
### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11050 follows the concept of the Central Mountain Conservation Axis to designate a belt of coastal protected areas, resolving the conflicts between protecting and exploiting existing coastal areas. Key performance indicator of the action plan (gray background represents non-quantitative)
* Complete the planning of national coastal belt of protected areas
* The area ratio of protected natural coastal belt to the total coastal belt in Taiwan
* Identify potential locations for conflicts between protection and exploitation.
### Background
The "coastal protection areas" are designed to protect important resources within the areas. The natural coast is the natural environment along the coast. It is an ecotone between the land and sea ecosystems and is an important habitat for coastal organisms. Natural coasts often have high biodiversity and are key conservation targets for protected areas. However, Taiwan has a high population density and is extensively developed. The situation makes it urgent to exploit coastal areas, which is against sustainable development. Therefore, maintaining and increasing the ratio of natural coasts is an important goal of sustainable development. This index is established as a criterion to judge whether various construction plans, such as land exploitation, dredging, and drainage, would affect the ecological environment in the protected areas.
### Definition and Calculation
The length ratio of the natural coastline to the total coastline in the coastal protected areas. The calculation method: the length of the natural coastline in the coastal protected areas/the total coastline length in the coastal protected areas.
### The data and temporal range
