## About the indicator



### Who are monitored?
Vegetation constitutes an important foundation of the ecosystem, reflecting climate patterns, natural environmental conditions, and the degree of human disturbance, and at the same time providing habitats for wildlife. It is one of the important indicators of terrestrial protected areas.

Vegetation map is an important tool for conservation, research, and management. The basic information about the vegetation in the protected areas can be used as the foundation for different operations and management such as designating protected areas, ecosystem maintenance, wildlife habitat allocation, and dynamic monitoring on populations. However, the coverage of the vegetation map in 2017's survey data is limited to state-owned forest land and experimental forest of National Taiwan University. Other areas such as mountain reserves, hillside land, plains, coasts, and outlying islands have yet to be completed.


### Important assumptions and remarks



### Definition and Calculation

According to the plant mapping process in the Forestry Bureau's "National Plant Diversity Survey and Mapping" project, set up "woody plant sample areas" and "herbaceous plant sample areas" for natural plants in the protected areas, and conduct surveys on vegetation types and construct information on diversity.
