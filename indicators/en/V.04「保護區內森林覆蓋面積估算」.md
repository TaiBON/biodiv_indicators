### 內容簡述
森林不只是樹木，森林是確保糧食安全、改善民生的根本所在。[聯合國糧農組織](http://www.fao.org/home/zh/) (Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO) 自 1946 以每 5 - 10 年進行一次全球性的[森林資源評估](http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/zh/) (Global Forest Resources Assessment, FRA)。

近百年來人類活動頻繁，造成森林生態環境上極大的衝擊亦影響人類發展，如每年加劇的天災、森林面積減少以致無法有效淨化空氣及水質等，因此森林的面積變化逐漸成為生態保育上重要的議題之一，除此之外亦可做為土地開發壓力的指標。

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
15.2 By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D00008 Establishment of forest cover data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and assessment and monitoring on forest health. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Estimation of the area of forest cover in Taiwan
* The area ratio of forest cover whose health is under the assessment and monitoring to national forest cover.
### Background
Forests are not just trees. Forests are essential to ensure food security and improve people's livelihood. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been conducting a Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) every 5-10 years since 1946. Forest cover is the most basic and direct indicator of forest resources. In the past 100 years, frequent human activities have caused great impacts on the ecological environment of forests and also affected human development. For example, natural disasters are intensifying every year, and the reduction of forest area makes it impossible to effectively purify air and water. Therefore, changes in forest cover have gradually become one of the important topics for ecological conservation. In addition, forest cover can also be used as an indicator of pressure of land exploitation.
### Definition and Calculation
Compare the "forest cover" with that of the "base year" within the protected areas. Count the forest area within the protected areas, and use the forest area in the year of opening or a certain year as the benchmark value to calculate the percentage of increase or decrease in the forest area each year.
