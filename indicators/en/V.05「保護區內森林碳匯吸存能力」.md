### 內容簡述
聯合國氣候變化政府間專家委員會 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change，IPCC) 於 1997 年將土地利用、土地利用變化及林業 (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry，LULUCF) 納入修訂版國家溫室氣體排放清冊指南 (IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories)，其中 LULUCF 就 1990 年後土地利用、森林及其他木質生物蓄積量的改變，造成碳排放及碳移除量進行估算。

由於臺灣區域計畫法、森林法對於林業用地變更以及森林伐採均已訂有相關規範，且自 1992 年起即實施禁伐天然林政策，至林地變更為其他使用之情形極少，因此可藉行政院農業委員會林務局第三次全國森林資源調查成果之林型面積，以及林業統計每年新植造林、伐採、薪材收穫及干擾等相關數據估算，透過森林地含碳量的改變了解該生態系之健康狀況 (環保署，2016) 。

### Corresponding targets
#### SDGs
15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D00008 Establishment of forest cover data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and assessment and monitoring on forest health. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Estimation of the area of forest cover in Taiwan
* The area ratio of forest cover whose health is under the assessment and monitoring to national forest cover.
### Background
In 1997, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations included land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) into the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Carbon emissions and carbon removals caused by changes in land use and forest and other woody biomass accumulations after 1990 were estimated in the guideline. The Spatial Planning Act and Forest Act in Taiwan have stipulated regulations for changes in forestry land and forest harvesting, and the ban on logging of natural forests has been implemented since 1992. As a result, there have been very few cases where forest land is changed to other uses. Therefore, we can use the forest area obtained in the Third National Forest Resources Survey (conducted by Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture), as well as the forestry data on annual new planting, harvesting, fuelwood harvesting, and disturbances, etc., to estimate the annual changes in carbon sequestration by Taiwan’s forest resources, and further understand the health of forest ecosystem.
### Definition and Calculation
Forest carbon sequestration in the protected areas. Estimate the total carbon dioxide removals by forest resources in the protected areas.
