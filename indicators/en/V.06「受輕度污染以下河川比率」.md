### SDGs
6.3 改善民眾居住衛生，提升河川水質；加強推動廢污水妥善 處理；以公共污水廠二級處理放流水循環利用作為新興水源，提升水資源利用效率、降低傳統水資源開發需求；加強事業廢污水排放稽查管制，查緝可疑污染源，遏止水質污染情形發生；優化河川水質以保障國民健康及維護生態體系；強化化學物質流向勾稽，精進管理效能。
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 8: By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D43010 formulates river pollution improvement plans and schedules, facilitating the nutrients and heavy metal content of rivers and estuaries are lower than international standards year by year. Action plan performance indicators：
* The water quality of the river reaches the ratio of the length of the river without hypoxia and no smell (DO>2mg/L).
* Number of estuaries with marine environmental quality reaching Class A and Class B standards.
## Background
Rivers are important freshwater waters that connect lakes, estuaries, coasts, and marine ecosystems. Due to Taiwan's dense population, nearby rivers in populated residential areas, agricultural areas, and industrial areas are vulnerable to pollution. When a river is polluted, it not only affects the river and the environment nearby but also deteriorates the soil conditions and indirectly affects the health of the creatures. In order to ensure the water resources are clean and the river ecosystem is not polluted, the smaller the length and the rate of serious pollution of rivers the better, and the greater the length and rate of uncontaminated rivers the better.
## Definition and Calculation
Based on the River Pollution Index (RPI) published by Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, the ratio of the total length of the river to the length of the lightly polluted river section is defined. RPI is based on the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) in the river water quality. The calculated index values are used to determine the degree of river pollution. River pollution index = (length of un(or slightly) polluted river + length of lightly polluted river) / total monitoring length of river
## Update
According to the information on the website of Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, the rate of rivers below the lightly polluted rivers in Taiwan is about 75%. Compared with 2017, it decreased by about 3.4%.
## Trends
From 1988, the rate of lightly polluted rivers below Taiwan has ranged from 70% to 80% in the 30 years.
