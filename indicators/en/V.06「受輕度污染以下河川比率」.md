### Brief Description
To ensure clean water resources and protect river ecosystems from pollution, a shorter length and lower proportion of severely polluted rivers is preferred, while a longer length and higher proportion of unpolluted or only slightly polluted rivers is desirable.

### Themes
Terrestrial protected areas
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
6.3: Improve water quality, wastewater treatment, and safe reuse. By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 8: By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D43010 Formulate improvement plans and schedules for river pollution to reduce the nutrients and heavy metal content of rivers and estuaries to the international standards year by year. Action plan performance indicators:
* Percentage of river length meeting the water quality standard for no hypoxia and no odor (DO > 2 mg/L)
* The number of estuaries with marine environmental quality reaching Class A and Class B standards
### Background
Rivers are important freshwater bodies that connect lakes, estuaries, coasts, and marine ecosystems. Due to Taiwan's dense population, rivers near residential, agricultural, and industrial areas are particularly susceptible to pollution. When a river is polluted, not only are the river and its surrounding terrestrial ecosystem affected, but soil conditions may also deteriorate, indirectly impacting the health of nearby organisms. To ensure clean water resources and protect river ecosystems from pollution, a shorter length and lower proportion of severely polluted rivers is preferred, while a longer length and higher proportion of unpolluted or only slightly polluted rivers is desirable.
### Definition and Calculation
Based on the River Pollution Index (RPI) published by the Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, the proportion of river length classified as unpolluted or slightly polluted is calculated against the total monitored river length. The RPI is determined using the concentrations of four water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), and ammonia nitrogen (NH₃-N). The resulting index value is used to assess the river pollution level.<br> River Pollution Index (RPI) = (Length of unpolluted or barely polluted rivers + Length of slightly polluted rivers) / Total monitored river length
### Updates
According to data from the Environmental Information Open Platform, the proportion of rivers in Taiwan that were slightly polluted or below (inclusive) in 2021 was 75.67%, a decrease of 1.76% from 2020.
### Trends
Over the past 30 years since 1991, the proportion of rivers in Taiwan classified as mildly polluted or better has generally ranged between 70% and 80%, with a low of 69% recorded in both 2007 and 2010. However, this proportion has consistently exceeded 75% in the past four years, indicating improved river water quality.
