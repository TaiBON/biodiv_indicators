### SDGs
15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11030 Review the existing system of protected areas, regularly conduct effectiveness evaluation and management tests, and improve management strategies and publicity of various types of protected areas. Action Plan Performance Indicator:
* Complete the planning of the national system of protected areas
* Number and proportion of various types of protected areas with regular evaluations of management effectiveness
## Background
A protected area refers to a clearly defined geographical area that is designated, controlled, and managed for specific protection purposes. Protected areas can provide multiple benefits for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Internationally, the establishment of protected areas is considered the main strategy for protecting species and ecosystems. In addition to biodiversity, the establishment of protected areas can also help protect the natural resources which local communities and indigenous people rely on, as well as areas of cultural importance. The area (size) of Taiwan's terrestrial protected areas is the area (size) announced by each protected area.
## Definition and Calculation
The total area (size) of terrestrial protected areas is the sum of areas of protected areas (national parks, national nature parks, nature protected areas, nature reserves, wildlife protected areas, important wildlife habitats) announced for each year.
## The data and temporal range
Annual Report on Nature Protected Areas in Taiwan and Fujian area (2006â€“2019)
## Updates
According to the latest update by the Nature Conservation Network of the Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, there are 95 protected areas including national parks, nature reserves, etc, and the area of terrestrial protected areas is 694,503.27 hectares.
## Trends
The area of protected areas has been changing slowly in the past four years, and the boundaries of each protected area have not been adjusted from 2016 to 2019, maintaining a total area of about 6,945 square kilometers.
