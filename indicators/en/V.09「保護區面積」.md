### SDGs
15.4 到2030年，保護山地生態系統，包括其生物多樣性，以便加強山地生態系統的能力，使其能夠帶來對可持續發展必不可少的益處。
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11030檢討現有保護區系統，並定期進行各類保護區成效評估、管考、改善管理策略及廣宣。 行動方案績效指標：
* Complete the planning of the national protected area system
* Number and proportion of various types of protected areas with regular assessment of management effectiveness
## Background
保護區係指一處明定地理範圍，為特定保護目的而指定、管制和管理的地區。保護區可為生物多樣性保護與永續發展提供多種益處。在國際間，設立保護區被認為是保護物種和生態系的主要策略。除了生物多樣性外，設立保護區也有助於保護當地社區和原住民所依賴的自然資源以及具有文化重要性的地區。臺灣陸域保護區面積，以各保護區公告之面積為準。
