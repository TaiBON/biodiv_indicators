### Brief Description
The annual extent of Taiwan’s terrestrial protected areas serves as an indicator of the portion of terrestrial ecosystems under legal protection, including the designated protected zones and their core areas.

### Themes
Terrestrial protected areas
### PSBR Model Type
Response (R)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11030 Review the existing system of protected areas, and regularly conduct effectiveness evaluations, performance monitoring, and strategy improvements, along with outreach for various types of protected areas.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan
* Complete the planning of the national system of protected areas
* Number and proportion of various types of protected areas with regular evaluations of management effectiveness
### Background
A protected area refers to a clearly defined geographical area that is designated, controlled, and managed for specific protection purposes. Protected areas can provide multiple benefits for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Internationally, the establishment of protected areas is considered the main strategy for protecting species and ecosystems. In addition to biodiversity, the establishment of protected areas can also help protect the natural resources which local communities and indigenous people rely on, as well as areas of cultural importance. The area (size) of Taiwan's terrestrial protected areas is the area (size) announced by each protected area.
### Definition and Calculation
The total area (size) of terrestrial protected areas is the sum of areas of protected areas (national parks, national nature parks, nature protected areas, nature reserves, wildlife protected areas, important wildlife habitats) announced for each year.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Annual Report on Nature Protected Areas of Taiwan-Fuchien Region (2006–2020)
### Updates
According to data from the Nature Conservation Network, there were 96 protected areas, including national parks, in 2020, with a total terrestrial area of 694,298.12 hectares. This represents a decrease of 204.95 hectares compared to 2019.
### Trends
Since 2011, the total area of the protected areas has remained relatively stable at around 694,000 hectares. After 2015, the total area has been maintained at 694,500 hectares.
