### SDGs
14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11030 Review the existing system of protected areas, regularly conduct effectiveness evaluations and management tests, and improve management strategies and publicity of various types of protected areas. Action Plan Performance Indicator:
* Complete the planning of the national system of protected areas
* Number and proportion of various types of protected areas with regular evaluations of management effectiveness
## Background
The establishment of evalution criteria is an important tool to assist decision-making and management. Among the many tasks in the global promotion of sustainable development, the development of indicators and evaluation systems to evaluate whether countries, major cities, and even communities are moving towards sustainability has become one of the priority tasks, because an effective evaluation system can monitor the environmental, economic and social progress and trends, and be as a basis for early warning, guiding decision-making, and improving strategies (Ling-Ling Lee, 2003). The establishment of protected areas does not necessarily mean that the species in the area are adequately protected. It is very necessary to evaluate whether the protected area has operational effectiveness.
## Definition and Calculation
The number of various protected areas with regular evaluations on management effectiveness, and its ratio to the total number of protected areas in Taiwan. Calculate the number and proportion of protected areas with regular evaluations on management effectiveness each year. The evaluation on management effectiveness is based on the evaluation framework established by the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), with the management cycle as the center. Stakehoders (e.g., manager of the protected area and decision-maker) form an evaluation team to perform the evaluation in an interactive workshop, and finally use a questionnaire to show the management efficiency of the protected area.
