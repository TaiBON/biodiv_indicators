### 發展背景
The establishment of evalution criteria is an important tool to assist decision-making and management. Among the many tasks in the global promotion of sustainable development, the development of indicators and evaluation systems to evaluate whether countries, major cities, and even communities are moving towards sustainability has become one of the priority tasks, because an effective evaluation system can monitor the environmental, economic and social progress and trends, and be as a basis for early warning, guiding decision-making, and improving strategies (Ling-Ling Lee, 2003). The establishment of protected areas does not necessarily mean that the species in the area are adequately protected. It is very necessary to evaluate whether the protected area has operational effectiveness.
### 定義及計算方式
The number of various protected areas with regular evaluations on management effectiveness, and its ratio to the total number of protected areas in Taiwan. Calculate the number and proportion of protected areas with regular evaluations on management effectiveness each year. The evaluation on management effectiveness is based on the evaluation framework established by the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), with the management cycle as the center. Stakehoders (e.g., manager of the protected area and decision-maker) form an evaluation team to perform the evaluation in an interactive workshop, and finally use a questionnaire to show the management efficiency of the protected area.
