## Background
Illegal hunting, including illegal hunting of wild animals and plant collection, is currently one of the main threats of global biodiversity. Article 10 of the Wildlife Conservation Act clearly stipulates that acts of harassing, cruelty, hunting or slaughtering of general wild animals, as well as collecting and cutting plants, etc. shall be regulated in the wildlife protection areas. Article 50 of the Forest Act clearly stipulates that anyone who steals forest main products and by-products, accepts, transports, stores, buys or medias stolen goods shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than six months but not more than five years, and with a penalty of NT$300,000 and NT$3 million fines. In the preceding paragraph, the attempted crime of stealing forest main products and by-products shall be punished.
## Definition and Calculation
Illegal hunting in the protected area includes the total number of cases of "hunting animals or catching fish", "picking plants" and "pirating stalactites, coral reefs, soil and rocks" in the National Parks of the Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior.
## The data and temporal range
Inquiry Network of the Statistics Department of the Ministry of the Interior-Cases of Violation of the National Park Law (2001-2019)
## Updates
In 2019, there were 74 cases of violations of the National Park Law. Kenting National Park had the largest number of illegal hunting cases, with 39 cases. Compared with 2018, the number of cases increased by 30, Kenting National Park increased by 5, Dongsha Atoll National Park and Taijiang National Park increased by 18 and 8 cases respectively, and Yangmingshan National Park decreased by one case.
## Trends
The number of illegal cases in the national park area was counted in 2001, and the number of illegal cases in Kenting National Park has been increasing; since 2011, the number of illegal cases in Yangmingshan National Park has dropped to single-digits. In the past 17 years, the total number of illegal cases in the national park area has been about 50 per year. Among them, the number of illegal cases in the Taijiang National Park in 2013 was nearly hundred. Therefore, the total number of illegal cases in the national park in that year was particularly high. In 2019, the number of cases in Dongsha Atoll National Park and Taijiang National Park increased by 18 and 8 respectively, which was the main reason for the increase in the number of cases that year.
