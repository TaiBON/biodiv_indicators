## Background
Poaching including illegal hunting of wild animals and harvesting plant is currently one of the main threats of global biodiversity. Article 10 of the Wildlife Conservation Act clearly stipulates that acts of harassing, abuse, hunting or slaughtering of common wild animals, as well as collecting and cutting plants, etc. in the wildlife protection areas shall be regulated. Article 50 of the Forest Act clearly stipulates that anyone who steals forest main products and by-products, accepts, transports, stores, buys or mediates purchases of stolen goods shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of six months~five years, and a fine of NT$300,000~NT$3 million. The attempted crime of stealing aforementioned forest main products and by-products shall be punished.
## Definition and Calculation
The total number of cases of poaching in the protected areas includes "hunting animals or catching fish", "picking plants" and "stealing stalactites, coral reefs, soil and rocks" in the National Parks of the Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior.
## The data and temporal range
Inquiry Network of the Statistics Department of the Ministry of the Interior-Cases of Violation of the National Park Law (2001-2019)
## Updates
In 2019, there were 74 cases of violation of the National Park Law. Kenting National Park had the largest number of poaching cases, 39 cases. Compared with 2018, the total number of cases increased by 30, Kenting National Park increased by 5, Dongsha Atoll National Park and Taijiang National Park increased by 18 and 8 cases respectively, and Yangmingshan National Park decreased by 1 case.
## Trends
The number of illegal cases in the national park areas has been counted since 2001, and the number of illegal cases in Kenting National Park has been increasing; since 2011, the number of illegal cases in Yangmingshan National Park has dropped to single-digits. In the past 17 years, the total number of illegal cases in the national park areas has been about 50 per year. Among them, the number of illegal cases in Taijiang National Park in 2013 was nearly hundred, resulting in a particularly high total number of illegal cases of that year. In 2019, the number of cases in Dongsha Atoll National Park and Taijiang National Park increased by 18 and 8 respectively, which was the main reason for the increase in the number of cases that year.
