### SDGs
15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 12: By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
### Biodiversity Action Plan

* Research items on the change of indicating species
## Background
Biodiversity is one of the major global issues at present, and it is also the foundation of sustainable development of human beings. The global biodiversity is in a trend of rapid loss. Biological species are gradually disappearing at a rate of one hundred to one thousand times. The increase in human population and resource consumption causes pollution, global warming and invasive species, and the crisis of Biodiversity has become a reality that all human beings should face today. Species diversity is the fundamental indicator of regional ecosystem. High species diversity means that the there are more taxa. In the case of overlapping niche, the overall ecosystem has higher stability and can tolerate disturbance.
## Definition and Calculation
Species number of all kinds of organisms in the protected area.
## The data and temporal range
Number of wild species in the National Park/National Nature Park area (1999–2017)
