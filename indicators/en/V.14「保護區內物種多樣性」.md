## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 12: By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D12030 Strengthen the research on population changes of indicator animals, plants, and micro organisms. Action plan key performance indicator:
* Research projects on the change of indicator species
## Background
Biodiversity is one of the major global issues at present and the foundation of the sustainable development of human beings. The global biodiversity is in a trend of rapid loss. Biological species are gradually disappearing at a rate of 100~1000 times of the rate before. With the increase in human population and resource consumption, plus the impact of pollution, global warming and invasive species, the crisis of biodiversity has become a reality that all human beings should face today. Species diversity is the fundamental indicator of the regional ecosystem. High species diversity means that there are more species populations. In the case of overlapping niche, the overall ecosystem has higher stability and can tolerate disturbance to a certain degree.
## Definition and Calculation
Species number of all organisms in the protected areas.
## The data and temporal range
Number of wild species in the National Park/National Nature Park areas (1999â€“2017)

## Updates
In 2017, Kenting National Park had the highest animal species diversity in the protected areas, with a total of 5,196 species; Yushan National Park had the highest plant species diversity, with a total of 2,565 species.
