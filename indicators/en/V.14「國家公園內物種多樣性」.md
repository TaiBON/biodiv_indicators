### Brief description
The indicator reflects whether the overall status of biodiversity in national parks is improving or declining. Each protected area may select target species for monitoring based on its unique species composition.

### Themes
Terrestrial protected areas
### PSBR Model Type
Status (S)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 12:<br> By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D12030 Strengthen the research on population changes of indicator animals, plants, and microorganisms.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Research projects on changes in indicator species populations
### Background
Biodiversity is one of the major global issues and is also the foundation of sustainable development for humanity.Global biodiversity is undergoing a rapid decline, with species becoming extinct at a rate of 100 to 1,000 times faster. The growing human population and resource consumption, further compounded by pollution, global warming, and the introcution of invasive species, have made the biodiversity crisis a reality that humanity must face today.Biodiversity is the most fundamental indicator of regional ecology. Higher biodiversity suggests that the ecosystem supports a greater variety of species populations. Because of overlapping ecological niches, the ecosystem tends to be more stable and resilient to a certain degree of disturbances.
### Definition and Calculation
Species count of different taxa within protected areas.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Number of Wildlife in National (Nature) Parks (1999-2021)
### Updates
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, in 2021, Kenting National Park recorded the highest number of animal species among protected areas, totaling 5,712 species. Yushan National Park had the highest plant biodiversity, with 2,772 plant species recorded.
