### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D21020 Complete the plan of monitoring system on terrestrial, wetland and marine biodiversity, including the confirmation of monitoring places and methods Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Determin the plan of locations and methods of national biodiversity monitoring
## Background
Wetland is the habitat environment which many wild animals and plants depend on for their livelihoods and plays an important role in the ecosystem. In addition, wetland also has the benefits of providing locations for sightseeing and recreation and improving the resiliance of the land to flood. In recent years, the environment around the wetlands has changed drastically due to the rapid increase in urbanization. Therefore, it has become an important topic to keep updated of changes in the wetland ecosystem and.
## Definition and Calculation
First, pair the land-use data of the Third Level Category 103 with the data of other land-use categories in the National Land-Use Survey, and asign an appropriate LDI coefficient. Second, overlay the layer of Important National Wetlands onto the layer of National Land-Use Survey for analysis. Then, based on the Taiwan Wetlands of Importance (Weng, 2007), classify the wetlands according to their locations and size of area. At the same time, a layer of land-use from the survey on wetland and its surrounding area of 100 meters outward was used as the range to calculate LDI value. The LDI value is caculated by adding all the results of area percentages multiplied by LDI coefficient of each land-use category, and its calculation formula is: LDItotal = Σ(%LUi × LDIi) (Brown and Vivas 2005) LDI value represents disturbance of human activity. The greater the value, the greater the degree of exploitation, and vice versa.
