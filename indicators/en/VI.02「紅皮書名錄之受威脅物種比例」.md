### 指標對應
#### SDGs
15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
#### 愛知目標
Target 12: By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
#### 生物多樣性行動方案
D31031 Develop and implement action plans for the endangered species research and conservation strategies (includes distribution, habitats, status, trends, monitoring, and threat factors). Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* The number of strategic action plans on endangered species research and conservation
* The complete ratio of strategic action plans on endangered species research and conservation (%)
### 發展背景
The red list is a list of assessments of the degree of threat to wild animals and plants. Many countries have developed their own species threat assessment methods or systems, but the most well-known and widely used of these is the Red List system developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN Red List is compiled according to strict guidelines to assess the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. The guidelines are based on species and regions and aim to reflect the urgency of conservation work to the public and decision-makers and to help the international community avoid species extinction. Through the Red List, we will understand more clearly the status of threats faced by the organisms in the country, the extent, causes, and trends.
### 定義及計算方式
The Endemic Species Research Institute and Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture assess the vulnerability of native species of birds, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fishes, terrestrial mammals, and vascular plants to publish national Red List based on IUCN assessment standards. Until 2018, six Red Lists were published. The number of threatened species in the Red List is to count the numbers of critical endangered (CR), endangered (EN), and vulnerable (VU) species.
### 現有資料內容及所跨年度
Percentage of threatened species in the Red List of each taxon (2016, 2017)
### 指標趨勢
The Red List of terrestrial mammals will be updated every five years, and currently it includes five taxa (birds, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fishes, and terrestrial mammals). The percentages of threatened species in amphibians and freshwater fishes are higher than other taxa, with 30% of species are endangered. The Red List of vascular plants is planned to be updated every ten years. It includes four taxa currently (lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms), and the percentages of threatened species in gymnosperms is as high as 52%.
