## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 12: By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D31031 To apply and execute the endangered species research and conservation strategy action plans (includes distribution, habitats, status, trends, monitoring, and threatened factors). Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* The number of endangered species research and conservation strategy action plans
* The complete ratio of endangered species research and conservation strategy action plans (%)
## Background
The Red List is an assessment list of threatened degrees of wild animals and plants. Many contries have developed their own threatened assement methods or systems, however, the most famous and widely used method is the Red List system developed by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN Red List is compiled to assess endangered risk of thousands of species and subspecies based on strict criteria. The criteria is determined on species and regions, and the purpose is to reflect the urgency of conservation tasks to the public and decision makers and help the international communities to prevent species extinction. We can clearly acknowledge the threatened states, degrees and changing trends of local organisms through the Red List.
## Definition and Calculation
The Endemic Species Research Institute and Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture assess vulnerability of native species of birds, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fishes, terrestrial mammals, and vascular plants to publish national Red List based on IUCN assessment standards. Until 2018, six Red Lists were published. The number of threatened species in the Red List is to count the numbers of critical endangered (CR), endangered (EN), and vulnerable (VU) species.
## The data and temporal range
The threatened species ratio in the Red Lists of each taxon (2016â€“2017)
## Trends
The Red List of terrestrial mammals will update every five years, and recently it includes five taxa (birds, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fishes, and terrestrial mammals). The threatened species ratio of amphibians and freshwater fishes is higher than other taxa, while 30% of species are endangered. The Red List of vascular plants is planned to update every ten years. It includes four taxa recently (lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms), while the ratio of threatened species of gymnosperms is 52%.
