#### SDGs
15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
#### 愛知目標
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
### 發展背景
Climate change has caused the average temperature of the environment to rise, the frequency of extreme meteorological events to increase, such as polarized rainfall in some areas, prolonged dry seasons, and increased frequency of heavy rains. These extreme weather events may impact avian populations. Warmer temperatures and prolonged dry seasons, may interfere with the migration clock of birds or disrupt the ecological coupling between birds and their habitats, reduce the synchronization between avian species and other species, and reduce the population size. Therefore, by monitoring the changes in the number and distribution of birds, we can understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity.
### 定義及計算方式
Take breeding birds in Taiwan as monitoring targets, we use long-term monitoring and ecological modeling to assess the influence of climate change on the distribution of birds. After select monitoring locations, conduct long-term breeding bird surveys to record bird species observed and their density. Biological modeling uses the current distribution of 151 breeding birds in Taiwan as a basis. The relationship between avian distribution and environmental variables is established using species distribution prediction models; then their short-term, mid-term, and long-term distribution patterns in the scenarios of climate change are predicted; finally, compare the changes in species diversity via GIS map overlay analysis.
