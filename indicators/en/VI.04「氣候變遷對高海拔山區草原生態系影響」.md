### SDGs
15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
## Background
High mountain ecosystem is one of sensitive areas under climate change. The high mountain grassland usually has unfavored growth conditions of plants, such as shallow soils, poor nutrients, low temperature, strong winds and heavy snows, and some specific species can adapt and grow in such extreme environments. However, under the climate change, many extreme climatic events, such as warm winter, drought and suddenly temperature decline after spring would disturb the phenology of high mountain species, and to obstruct population renewal and cause the decline of population. Furthermore, climate warming would also cause invasive species that were originally suppressed by low temperatures to gradually move up, threatening native and endemic plant populations.
## Definition and Calculation
To understand if climate change could affect the high mountain ecosystems, we selected the vegetation survey of high mountain grassland ecosystem to analyze species, vegetation and environmental factors at vertical and horizontal gradients. To understand the influence of temperature change on species abundance, we also estimated the long-term monitoring data (includes herbal species composition, abundance) in the high mountain grassland ecosystems, and used temperature data of meteorological station to perform relational and regression analyses.
