### 發展背景
Birds are a well-known taxon to the public, which has long-term monitoring data and is considered to be an excellent indicator of environmental health. Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a large-scale and long-term survey project for common birds. The project incorporates government agencies and non-governmental organizations, through the participation of citizen scientists, to monitor the populations of common birds in Taiwan with the same standardized survey methods. Through the temporal and spatial changes of common bird populations, the relationship between the environment and bird populations is derived which provides important information for management and decision-making.
### 定義及計算方式
Raw data is the survey results on 92 common bird species in Taiwan from different years, which represents the spatial density and temporal frequency of bird monitoring. The Common Breeding Bird indicator uses the population data of common bird species obtained from surveys within a specific year as the baseline and the tally of population data from different locations and years to calculate the number of birds in different habitats. The code of the diagram is listed as the following:
| Codes | Represented habitats     |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| A     | Forest                   |
| B     | Farmland                 |
| C     | Herbal vegetation        |
| D     | Freshwater               |
| E     | Fish farm and salt field |
| F     | Coastal areas            |
| G     | Buildings                |
| H     | Others                   |
### 現有資料內容及所跨年度
每年度之常見繁殖鳥類監測統計資料(2009-2020年)
### 指標趨勢
歷年的調查結果均以棲息於農耕地與森林的鳥類數量最多。此外，棲息於建築區的鳥類數量則有逐年增加的趨勢。鳥類豐富度的趨勢變化主要受到使用森林、農耕地與建築區的鳥類數量的影響。農耕地與建築區鳥類數量的增加，可能與都市化程度增加與都市面積擴張有關。
