### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D12030 To enhance research of population changes of indicating animals, plants, and microorganisms. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Research items of changes of indicating species
## Background
Bird is a well known taxon to the public, which has long-term monitoring data and is considered to be an excellent environmental health indicator. Breeding bird survey (BBS) is a large-scale and long-term suvery project for common birds. The project incorperate government agencies and non-governmental organizations, through the participation of citizen scientists, to monitor the populations of common birds in Taiwan with same standardized survey methods. Through the temporal and spatial changes of common bird populations, the relationship among the environment and bird populations is derived, and to provide important information for management and decision-making.
## Definition and Calculation
Raw data is composed of 92 common bird species derived from all of the surveys in Taiwan, which represents the spatial density and temporal frequency of avian monitoring. the common bird indicator is based on the number of avian surveys within a specific year. The indicator uses the statistics of common birds in different years, and uses the number of bird in different habitat to calculate. The code of the diagram is listed as the following:
| Code | Represented habitats     |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| A    | Forest                   |
| B    | Farmland                 |
| C    | Herbal vegetation        |
| D    | Freshwater               |
| E    | Fish farm and salt field |
| F    | Coastal areas            |
| G    | Buildings                |
| H    | Others                   |
## The data and temporal range
Annual statistics of common breeding birds monitoring project (2009â€“2017)
## Trends
From the trending diagram, the overall quantity of birds have been an increasing tendency, however, the bird species that prefer to inhabit in the farmland near the areas of human activity are increasing. The reason would be the degradation of natural habitats due to range expansion of human colonization or invasion of alien species, and change the ratio among years. It still needs to be confirmed by examing locations and landscape changes.
