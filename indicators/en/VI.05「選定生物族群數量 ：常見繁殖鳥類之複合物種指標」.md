### Brief Description

The indicator of breeding bird populations is monitored through tracking the population status of commonly recognized breeding bird species, serving as an indicator of environmental health.According to the systematic nationwide data from the Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS Taiwan) from 2011 to 2019, recent results show that the Multi-Species Indicators (MSIs) for forest and farmland bird populations have not changed significantly, but exhibit a slow and steady upward trend, suggesting that forest and agricultural environments remain relatively stable.However, as farmland environments may be subject to more frequent disturbances, the MSI trends show slight fluctuations.The MSI of alien bird species show a significant upward trend, indicating that these species are rapidly increasing in number and expanding their range.By studying the long-term population trends of common breeding bird species across forests, farmlands, and other habitat types, we can gain deeper insights into the relationship between environmental conditions and bird populations, thereby providing a critical scientific basis for environmental management and conservation policy-making.

### Background

The Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS Taiwan) was launched in 2011 as a citizen science project. Through cooperation between the government and non-governmental organizations, it monitors the species and numbers of birds using point-count methods during the breeding season from March to June each year.The long-term data accumulated by this project (2011 to date) represent Taiwan's first large-scale systematic nationwide monitoring of breeding birds and is also a pioneering initiative within the East Asia region.

### Definition and Calculation

The raw data consists of the species and counts of breeding birds collected annually from approximately 300 survey sites nationwide.Long-term monitoring allows for the quantification and analysis of population trends in birds with different characteristics, such as habitat preference, endemism, and altitudinal distribution.

| Type     | Habitat type                                                                                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forest   | Forest-related habitats                                                                                              |
| Farmland | Agricultural-related habitats                                                                                        |
| Others   | No obvious habitat preference, or prefer habitats other than forest and farmland, such as freshwater and urban areas |

### Data Coverage and Time Span

Long-term monitoring data of breeding birds from 2011 to 2021.

### Trends

The latest research results show that (2011-2021) among the 105 breeding bird species

- Taiwan Forest Bird Index (52 species): insignificant change.
- Taiwan Farmland Bird Index (20 species): insignificant change.
- Taiwan Alien Bird Index (7 species): significant increase.<br>
     The index of both forest and farmland bird exhibited slow and steady upward trend, suggesting that forest and agricultural environments remain relatively stable.However, as farmland environments may be subject to more frequent disturbances, the MSI trends show slight fluctuations.
