### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D12030 To enhance research of population changes of indicating animals, plants, and microorganisms. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Research items of changes of indicating species
## Background
Recently, the massive reduction of regional frog populations has become an important global issue. Along with climate change, environmental destruction, human disturbance and invasion of alien species, the number of frogs has decreased rapidly, and over 30% of frog species are endangered or extinct. Through participation of citizen scientists, this indicator monitors the populations of common frogs in Taiwan with the same standardized methods of investigation. Through the temporal and spatial changes of common frog populations, to understand the influence of climate chagne and environmental disturbance on populations of frogs, and provide important information for management and decision-making.
## Definition and Calculation
Calculate the number of native, endemic, and alien species in common frogs of Taiwan based on the investigation data of amphibians resources, and calculate the individual percentage of total number of these three categories in each year to understand the composition trends.
## Updates
A total of 109,214 frogs were recorded in Taiwan from November 13th, 2017 to November 12th, 2018. Among them, the largest number is Latouchte's frog (*Hylarana latouchii*), with a total of 12,295. The second one is alien Spot-legged tree frog (*Polypedates megacephalus*), with a total number of 11,572. Alien species account for 10.76%, native species 54.22%, and endemic species 35.03%.
## Trends
The biodiversity indicator trend diagram shows that the population of alien Spot-legged tree frog (*Polypedates megacephalus*) has expanded. The proportion of alien species has increased year by year, and the proportion of native species has decreased year by year. The research by Prof. Y.-R. Yang (2015) of National Dong Hua University reveals that the Spot-legged tree frog might compete and exclude the native Brauer's tree frog (*Polypedates braueri*), and affect its population.
