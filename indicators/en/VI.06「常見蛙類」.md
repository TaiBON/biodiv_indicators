### Brief Description
Frogs can rapidly respond to various environmental changes, and are therefore important environmental indicator organisms.

### Themes
Population of selected taxa
### PSBR Model Type
State (S)
### Corresponding Targets
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D12030 Strengthen the research on population changes of indicator animals, plants, and microorganisms.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan
* Research projects on the change of indicator species
### Background
In recent years, the dramatic decline of regional frog populations has become a major global concern. Frog numbers have dropped rapidly due to climate change, habitat destruction, human disturbance and invasion of alien species. More than 30% frog species are now endangered or extinct. With contributions from citizen scientists, this indicator uses a standardized survey methodology to monitor the population of common frog species across Taiwan. Spatio-temporal changes in common frog population serve as a proxy for understanding the impacts of climate change and habitat disturbances, providing valuable information for management and decision-making.
### Definition and Calculation
Calculate the number of native, endemic, and alien species in common frogs of Taiwan based on the data of amphibians resources survey, and calculate the individual percentage of total number of these three categories each year to understand the composition trends.
### Updates
According to the Taiwan Amphibian Database, a total of 74,192 individual frogs were recorded in 2021. Of them, 11.46% were introduced species, and 56.56% were non-endemic native species, and 31.98% were endemic to Taiwan. This represents a decrease of 12,543 individuals compared to the 2020 record.
### Trends
The indicator trend showed that since 2010, the population of the introduced Spot-legged tree frog (*Polypedates megacephalus*) have been expanding.
