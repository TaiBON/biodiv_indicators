### Brief Description

Frogs can rapidly respond to various environmental changes, and are therefore important environmental indicator organisms.

### Themes

Population of selected taxa

### PSBR Model Type

Status (S)

### Corresponding Targets

#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets

Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.

#### Biodiversity Action Plan

D12030 Strengthen the research on population changes of indicator animals, plants, and microorganisms.

#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:

- Research projects on changes in indicator species populations

### Background

In recent years, the dramatic decline of regional frog populations has become a major global concern. Frog numbers have dropped rapidly due to climate change, habitat destruction, human disturbance and invasion of alien species. More than 30% frog species are now endangered or extinct.With contributions from citizen scientists, this indicator uses a standardized survey methodology to monitor the population of common frog species across Taiwan.Spatio-temporal changes in common frog population serve as a proxy for understanding the impacts of climate change and habitat disturbances, providing valuable information for management and decision-making.

### Definition and Calculation

Based on Taiwan Amphibian Database, the number of native, endemic, and introduced frog species among common frogs is calculated across different regions of Taiwan. The annual percentage of each of these 3 groups is then determined to analyze trends in species composition over time.

### Updates

According to the Taiwan Amphibian Database, a total of approximately 74,192 individual frogs were recorded in 2021. Of them, 12.01% were introduced species, and 87.98% were native species, among which 25.61% were endemic to Taiwan.This represents a decrease of 13,017 individuals compared to the 2020 record.

### Trends

The indicator trend showed that since 2010, the population of the alien Tree Frog (<i>Polypedates megacephalus</i>) have been expanding. The proportion of introduced species has increased year by year, while the proportion of the native species has decreased gradually.In 2018, introduced species accounted for 11.58% of the population, a significant increase compared to 1.16% in 2010, indicating substantial population growth over the eight-year period.A study by Professor Yang, Yi-ju of Donghua University (2015) indicated that Spot-legged tree frog may outcompete the native Brauer's tree frog (<em x-id="3">Polypedates braueri</em>) Brandt’s tree frog, thereby affecting its population.
