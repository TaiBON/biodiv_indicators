## Background
The black-faced spoonbill belongs to the subfamily Plataleinae, and are commonly called "Hai-Pi" (Taiwanese Mandarian pronunciation of black spoonbill) by bird watchers. It is one of the global critical endangered species, and the total number does not exceed three thousand. The Taijiang National Park is currently the winter habitat with the largest number of black-faced spoonbills in the world, and the maximum number is almost more than one thousand in recent years. In accordance with the Wildlife Conservation List announced by Wildlife Conservation Law, Council of Agriculture, black-faced spoonbill is listed as critical endangered.
## Definition and Calculation
全球普查之計算方法(中華鳥會)：每年一月中旬至下旬黑面琵鷺族群數量較穩定時，調查單位選擇近年已知黑面琵鷺曾利用之棲地作為樣區，計算族群數量。每個團體每次進行之調查視為一次獨立有效取樣，若某地區有兩次調查，則取數量較多者為該地區該年度之數量。 特生七股研究中心自2011年起每日進行定點觀測台江濕地黑面琵鷺數量，已累積6年的觀測資料。 自1993年開始進行黑面琵鷺全球同步普查，國際鳥盟支會香港觀鳥會於2003年起開始統籌全球同步普查，由各地資深賞鳥人士、研究人員和鳥類學家共同義務進行。臺灣、香港、澳門、越南和日本的普查結果由當地的統籌員收集和整理，各地調查結果由香港觀鳥會統整分析並發佈。 補抓繫放研究：選擇不同區域不同族群之個體，在其腳上繫色環以利辨識，並於其中選取個體裝設無線電發報器，以監測渡冬期間在渡冬地的活動範圍，同時選擇適宜個體裝設衛星發報器，紀錄於島內南北遷徙之資訊。
## The data and temporal range
Global consensus of black-faced spoonbill (2007–2019)
## Updates
In 2019, a total of 2,407 individuals were recorded in Taiwan, accounting for about 54% of the global population, and increased 212 individuals compared to 2018.
## Trends
The data of the trend map is from the global synchronous census of black-faced spoonbill. Since 2011, the number of black-faced spoonbill has increased year by year, and more than half of the populations still spend winter in Taiwan.
