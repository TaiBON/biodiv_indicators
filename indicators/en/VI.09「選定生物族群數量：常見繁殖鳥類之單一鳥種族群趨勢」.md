### Brief description

The trend of breeding bird populations is monitored through tracking the population status of commonly recognized breeding bird species, serving as an indicator of environmental health.According to the systematic nationwide data from the Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS Taiwan) from 2011-2021, notable changes was observed in the population trends of Taiwan's breeding bird species: 20 species exhibited statistically significant increases, 14 species showed significant declines, and the remaining species did not demonstrate significant changes.By studying the long-term population trends of common breeding bird species across forests, farmlands, and other habitat types, we can gain deeper insights into the relationship between environmental conditions and bird populations, thereby providing a critical scientific basis for environmental management and conservation policy-making.

### Background

The Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS Taiwan) was launched in 2011 as a citizen science project. Through cooperation between the government and non-governmental organizations, it monitors the species and numbers of birds adopting point-count methods during the breeding season from March to June each year.The long-term data accumulated by this project (2011 to date) represent Taiwan's first large-scale systematic nationwide monitoring of breeding birds and is also a pioneering initiative within the East Asia region.

### Definition and Calculation

The raw data consist of records of bird species and their counts at each survey point during the breeding season of each year.Long-term monitoring enables the quantification and analysis of spatio-temporal changes in bird population sizes across different habitats, including forests, farmlands, and other environments.“Others” here refer to bird species that show a preference for both forests and farmlands, as well as those that prefer habitat types other than forests and farmlands, such as freshwater and urban areas.By standardizing the data from different years to a specific baseline year, trends in population changes can be quantitatively assessed.

| Type     | Habitat type                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forest   | Forest-related habitats                                                                                                               |
| Farmland | Agricultural-related habitats                                                                                                         |
| Others   | No obvious habitat preference, or prefer habitats other than forest and farmland, such as freshwater and urban areas. |

### Data Coverage and Time Span

Long-term monitoring data of breeding birds from 2011 to 2021.

### Trends

The latest research results show that (2011-2021) among the 105 breeding bird species:

- Significantly increased species (20 species): 13 species are forest-preferring bird species (<i>Arborophila crudigularis</i>, <i>Chalcophaps indica</i>, <i>Psilopogon nuchalis</i>, <i>Dendrocitta formosae</i>, <i>Oriolus traillii</i>, <i>Periparus ater</i>, <i>Hypsipetes leucocephalus</i>, <i>Pnoepyga formosana</i>, <i>Ficedula hyperythra</i>, <i>Dicaeum minullum</i>, <i>Dicaeum ignipectus</i>, <i>Picus canus</i>, <i>Lophura swinhoii</i>), 4 species are farmland-preferring bird species (<i>Anas zonorhyncha</i>, <i>Spilopelia chinensis</i>, <i>Elanus caeruleus</i>, <i>Riparia chinensis</i>), and the other 3 species are <i>Gorsachius melanolophus</i>, <i>Alcedo atthis</i> and <i>Parus monticolus</i>.
- Significantly decreased species (14 species): 5 species are forest-preferring bird species (<i>Horornis acanthizoides</i>, <i>Trochalopteron morrisonianum</i>, <i>Carpodacus formosanus</i>, <i>Schoeniparus brunneus</i>, <i>Alcippe morrisonia</i>), 6 are farmland-preferring bird species (<i>Lanius schach</i>, <i>Alauda gulgula</i>, <i>Hirundo tahitica</i>, <i>Cecropis striolata</i>, <i>Prinia inornata</i>, <i>Passer montanus</i>), and the other 3 species are <i>Phoenicurus fuliginosus</i>, <i>Sinosuthora webbiana</i> and <i>Pycnonotus sinensis</i>.Compared to previous studies, the number of bird species showing significant decline has increased, indicating the survival condition of some species has become more critical and require greater attention and conservation efforts.
