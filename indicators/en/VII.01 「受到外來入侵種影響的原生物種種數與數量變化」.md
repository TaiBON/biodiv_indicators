### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevension of invasive species
1. Develop an emergency extermination plan for new invasive species, and cooperate with local governments in regular exercises.
2. Establish a long-term prevention plan for invasive organisms to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.

Key performance indicator of action plan:
* Number of species, areas, and extinguishment cases handled or executed for the invasive species control plan
* The decreasing ratio or amount of the distribution or number of invasive species
## Background
The species that carried away from the original habitat and enter new habitat or ecosystems through trade, transportation, travel and sightseeing activities are called alien species. Some alien species will become invasive alien species due to their strong adaptability and competitive advantage of survival. The alien invasive species will threaten the survival of native species, destroy the balance of the native ecosystems, and resulting in a decrease of biodiversity.
## Definition and Calculation
The local ecosystem would be influenced by alien invasive species, and result in decreasing of the species number and quantity of native species. This indicator takes the invasion year as a base year, and to summarize the species number and quantity changes of the influenced native species.
