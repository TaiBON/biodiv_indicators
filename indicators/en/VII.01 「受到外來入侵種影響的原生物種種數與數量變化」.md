### Brief Description
In addition to causing economic damage, alien species have a more direct impact by competing with native species for habitats and food resources. This competition, along with exclusion or hybridization, often leads to a decline in native species populations or even their extinction.

### Themes
Invasive species
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevention of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency eradication plan for new invasive species and conduct regular drills with local governments.
2. Establish a long-term control plan for invasive species to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of existing invasive species, affected areas, and eradication cases handled/executed in the invasive species control plan.
* The reduction rate of distribution range/number of existing invasive species. The reduction in the number of individuals of existing invasive species.
### Background
Species that are transported from native environments to new habitats or ecosystems through trade, transportation, travel, and sightseeing activities are called alien species. Some alien species will become invasive alien species due to their strong adaptability and advantages in competition for survival. The alien invasive species will threaten the survival of native species, destroy the balance of the native ecosystems, and result in a decrease in biodiversity.
### Definition and Calculation
The local ecosystem can be affected by invasive species, leading to a decrease in the number and population of native species. Using the year of invasion as the baseline, changes in the number and population of affected native species are recorded and analyzed.
