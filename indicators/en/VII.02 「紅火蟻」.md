## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevention of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency eradication plan for new invasive species and conduct regular drills with local governments.
2. Establish a long-term control plan for invasive species to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.

Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of existing invasive species, affected areas, and eradication cases handled/executed in the invasive species control plan.
* The reduction rate of distribution range/number of existing invasive species. The reduction in the number of individuals of existing invasive species.
## Background
Understand the current distribution, reproduction and habitat utilization of the fire ants through monitoring, and discuss the impact of fire ants on native species.
## Definition and Calculation
Changes in the distribution of the fire ants. The monitoring of the fire ants is conducted by the National Red Imported Fire Ant Control Center, the Agriculture Research and Extension Station of each district under the Council of Agriculture, and the county and city governments. Reports of local residents are also used to compile the occurrence and prevalence of the fire ants in Taiwan. The prevalent area is the area where the occurrence of fire ants is more serious.
## The data and temporal range
Tally of occurring areas of fire ants (2005â€“2020)
## Updates
According to data updated in January 2020, counties and cities affected by fire ants are mainly concentrated in northwestern Taiwan, including New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, and Jinmen County. Among them, Taoyuan City and Jinmen County are the most severely affected counties. Currently, the affecting areas of fire ants have not yet spread throughout Taiwan, but due to its strong ability of migration, prevention and control measures are needed in key areas.
## Trends
The prevalent areas have more than ten times a year of fire ants occurrence, found in the investigation of these areas. The indicator trend chart shows that the number of counties, cities, and towns where fire ants are prevalent is increasing every year. In 2015, government agencies started to invest in prevention and control operations, and in 2016, the number of prevalent towns and villages decreased significantly. However, there was a slight rebound from 2017 to 2020, and continuous control and prevention are still necessary.
