### Brief Description
Monitoring the current distribution, reproduction, and habitat use of red imported fire ants allows for the assessment of their impact on native species and the development of appropriate control and surveillance strategies.

### Themes
Invasive species
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevention of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency eradication plan for new invasive species and conduct regular drills with local governments.
2. Establish a long-term control plan for invasive species to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of existing invasive species, affected areas, and eradication cases handled/executed in the invasive species control plan.
* The reduction rate of distribution range/number of existing invasive species. The reduction in the number of individuals of existing invasive species.
### Background
Monitoring the current distribution, reproduction, and habitat use of red imported fire ants allows for the assessment of their impact on native species.
### Definition and Calculation
Changes in the distribution of red Imported fire ants. The monitoring of RIFA is carried out by National Red Imported Fire Ant Control Center, multiple Argricultural Research and Extension Stations under Ministry of Agriculture, and various local governments. Reports from local residents are also integrated to identify hotspots and prevalence of the fire ants across Taiwan. Area with widespread infestations are designated as prevelance zones.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Reported area of red imported fire ant occurrence (2005â€“2021)
### Updates
According to data compiled by National Red Imported Fire Ant Control Center, the December 2021 update showed occurrence report in 9 cities/counties, and 23 townships/cities/districts across 4 of cities/counties were classified as prevalence areas. Compared to 2020, the number of cities/counties with reported occurrence decreased by 1, the other 2 indicators remained unchanged.
### Trends
Prevalence area are defined as locations where RIFA occurrence were reported more than 10 times per year within the survey area. As shown in the figure, the number of prevalent cities/counties and townships/cities/districts has steadily increased over years. Government's efforts on RIFA prevention in 2015 led to a considerably decrease in the numbers of prevalence areas (townships/cities/districts) in 2016. However, the resurgence observed between 2017 and 2020 highlights the need for sustained prevention and control measures.
