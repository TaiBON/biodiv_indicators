## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevension of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency extermination plan for new invasive species, and cooperate with local governments in regular exercises.
2. Establish a long-term prevention plan for invasive organisms to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.

Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of species, areas, and extinguishment cases handled or executed for the invasive species control plan
* The decreasing ratio or amount of the distribution or number of invasive species
## Background
Discuss the impact of the red fire ants on native species through monitoring to understand the current distribution, reproduction and habitat utilization of the red fire ants.
## Definition and Calculation
Changes in the distribution of the red fire ants. The monitoring of the red fire ants is detected by the National Red Imported Fire Ant Control Center, the Agriculture Research and Extension Station of each district under the Council of Agriculture, and the county and city governments. The monitoring is also compiled with notification of local residents to consolidate the occurrence and prevalence of the red fire ants. The prevalent occurrence area is the area where the occurrence of red fire ants is more serious.
## The data and temporal range
Statistics of occurring areas of fire ants (2005â€“2020)
## Updates
According to data updated in January 2020, counties and cities mainly affected by red fire ants are concentrated in northwestern Taiwan, including New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, and Jinmen County. Among them, Taoyuan City and Jinmen County are the most severely affected counties. Recently, the harming distribution of red fire ants has not yet spread to all Taiwan, but due to its strong migration, it needs to be prevented and controlled in the key areas.
## Trends
The prevalent occurrence area indicates that the red fire ants occur more than ten times a year in the investigation of the area. It can be seen from the indicator trend chart that the number of counties, cities and towns where red fire ants are prevalent is increasing year by year. In 2015, the government agencies invested in prevention and control operations. In 2016, the number of prevalent townships decreased significantly. However, there was slightly getting back from 2017 to 2020, and it needs to control and prevent continuously.
