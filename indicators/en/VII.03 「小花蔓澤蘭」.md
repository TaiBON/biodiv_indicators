## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevension of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency extermination plan for new invasive species, and cooperate with local governments in regular exercises.
2. Establish a long-term prevention plan for invasive organisms to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.

Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of species, areas, and extinguishment cases handled or executed for the invasive species control plan
* The decreasing ratio or amount of the distribution or number of invasive species
## Background
The growth and spread of *Mikania micrantha* is extremely fast, which can ravage the lowland and foothills all over Taiwan in a short time, resulting in serious damage to farmlands, orchards, artificial and shelter forests, causing severe losses at social and economic levels. It is required to be monitored and prevented.
## Definition and Calculation
Changes in the area covered by *Mikania micrantha*. Endemic Species Research Institute, Council of Agriculture conducts the monitoring project of *Mikania micrantha* and request corresponding agencies of each county and city to report coverage area of *Mikania micrantha*, and then the Forest Bureau compiled the statistics of "Alien plant species coverage of Taiwan and Fujian areas—*Mikania micrantha*" before the end of next May.
## The data and temporal range
Covered area of *Mikania micrantha* (2005–2018)
## Updates
According to the data of 2018, the coverage area of *Mikania micrantha* in Taiwan's communal and private forests, national forests and aboriginal reserves is 4,948.69 hectares.
## Trends
