### Brief Description
The rapid vine growth of bittervine/American rope (*Mikania micrantha*) enables it to quickly spread across lowland areas throughout Taiwan, severely impacting the framlands, orchards plantations, and protection forests, which results in significant socio-economic losses. This underscores the urgent need to strengthen monitoring and prevention measures (Huang et al. 2004).

### Themes
Invasive species
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevention of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency eradication plan for new invasive species and conduct regular drills with local governments.
2. Establish a long-term control plan for invasive species to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of existing invasive species, affected areas, and eradication cases handled/executed in the invasive species control plan.
* The reduction rate of distribution range/number of existing invasive species. The reduction in the number of individuals of existing invasive species.
### Background
The rapid vine growth of bitter vine/American rope (*Mikania micrantha*) enables it to quickly spread across lowland areas throughout Taiwan, severely impacting the framlands, orchards plantations, and protection forests, which results in significant socio-economic losses. This underscores the urgent need to strengthen monitoring and prevention measures.
### Definition and Calculation
Changes in area coverage of bitter vine. The monitoring of *Mikania micrantha* (bitter vine) has been coordinated by the Taiwan Biodiversity Research Institute under the Ministry of Agriculture, Executive Yuan. Local governments and relecant agencies were requested to report the area covered the species during the control and elimiation process. Based on these reports, the Forestry and Nature Consercation Agency, Ministry of Agricultur, complied the data into statistical table titled "Coverage Rate of Alien Plant Species in the Taiwan-Fujian Region – *Mikania micrantha*" by the end of May the following year.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Area coverage by *Mikania micrantha*  (2005–2021)
### Updates
In 2021, the area covered by *Mikania micrantha* in farmlands, public and private forests, national forests, and aboriginal reserve lands totaled 3,392.11 hectares.
### Trends
(under improvement; not yet disclosed)
### Data Management/Authorities
