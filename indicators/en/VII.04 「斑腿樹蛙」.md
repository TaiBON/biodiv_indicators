### Brief Description
The spot-legged tree frog and Brauer's tree frog (*Polypedates braueri*) share similar habitat preferences. Once invaded, the alien species may compete with Brauer's tree frog and other native tree frogs, and thus the monitoring and control effort are necessary (Yang et al. 2018).

### Themes
Invasive species
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevention of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency eradication plan for new invasive species and conduct regular drills with local governments.
2. Establish a long-term control plan for invasive species to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of existing invasive species, affected areas, and eradication cases handled/executed in the invasive species control plan.
* The reduction rate of distribution range/number of existing invasive species. The reduction in the number of individuals of existing invasive species.
### Background
The tadpoles of spot-legged tree frog prey on those of native frogs in Taiwan and competes for habitats with other Brauer's tree frog and other native tree frogs, resulting in ecological imbalance. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and control the population and distribution of the spot-legged tree frogs.
### Definition and Calculation
Changes in the distribution and abundance of the spot-legged tree frogs. The occurence sites and counts of spot-legged tree frog were surveyed volunteer teams. The Lab of Amphibian Conservation at National Dong Hwa University compiled the data and visualized the changes in the species' distribution using GIS technology.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
The occurrence sites and counts of Spot-legged tree frog (2010–2021)
### Updates
According to the data compiled by the Lab of Amphibian Conservation at National Dong Hwa University, a total of 10,830 spot-legged tree frogs were recorded in 2021. This represents a decrease of 3,160 individuals compared to 2020. Notably, the total number of all frog species recorded in the same survey year also decreased by 12,543 individuals compared to the previous year.
### Trends
The indicators clearly show that the distribution range of spot-legged tree frog has expaneded over the survey years, with the number of recorded occurence increased steadily from 2010 to 2020. The occurrence sites have spread to areas such as Hengchun and Hualien. According to Professor Yi-Ju Yang of National Dong Hwa University, the invasion of the spot-legged tree frog has reached Stage IV of the invasion process – the population has grown too large to be eradicated or contained.Therefore, a long-term management strategy is needed to evaluate pretection measures for related native species.
