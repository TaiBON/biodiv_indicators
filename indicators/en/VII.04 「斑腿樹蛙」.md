## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevension of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency extermination plan for new invasive species, and cooperate with local governments in regular exercises.
2. Establish a long-term prevention plan for invasive organisms to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.

Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of species, areas, and extinguishment cases handled or executed for the invasive species control plan
* The decreasing ratio or amount of the distribution or number of invasive species
## Background
The tadpoles of the tree-legged tree frog will prey on the native Taiwanese frog tadpoles, and will also compete the habitats with the Brauer's tree frog (*Polypedates braueri*) and other native tree frogs. The tree-legged tree frog will cause the ecological imbalance of native tree frogs, and it requires to control and monitor the distribution and quantity of spot-legged tree frog population.
## Definition and Calculation
Changes of the distribution and number of spot-legged tree frogs. The occurrence and number of spot-legged tree frogs are mainly investigated through a volunteer team, and then the data are compiled by the amphibian conservation lab of National Donghua University, and to represent the distribution change of spot-legged tree frog using GIS layers.
## The data and temporal range
Occurrence and quantity of *Polypedates megacephalus* (2010–2018)
## Updates
From November 13, 2017 to November 12, 2018, a total of 11,572 spot-legged tree frog were recorded in Taiwan.
## Trends
According to the results of the biodiversity indicator, it can be clearly seen that the distribution of the spot-legged tree frog increases with the year, and the number of observations has also increased by year from 2010–2018. Although the number of observations has slightly decreased in 2014, the number of observations has increased again, and it has been spreading to Hengchun, Hualien, etc. Prof. Y.-R. Yang said that the spot-legged tree frog has entered the fourth stage of invasion—the population is too large to eradicate and contain. It is necessary to consider how to carry out long-term management and evaluate management to protect native species.
