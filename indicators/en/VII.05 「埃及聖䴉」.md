## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevension of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency extermination plan for new invasive species, and cooperate with local governments in regular exercises.
2. Establish a long-term prevention plan for invasive organisms to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.

Key performance indicator of the action plan
* Number of species, areas, and extinguishment cases handled or executed for the invasive species control plan
* The decreasing ratio or amount of the distribution or number of invasive species
## Background
The Egyptian Sacred Ibis is native to Africa and the Middle East. In 1984, the wild individuals of the Egyptian Sacred Ibis were first recorded in Guandu, Taipei. Nowadays, it has widely spread all over the western coastal wetlands in Taiwan. There is a lot of overlap between the Egyptian Sacred Ibis and the local heron birds in Taiwan in terms of food, nest trees and other ecological resources. Their high environmental adaptability and wide variety of diets have a competitive exclusion effect on the survival and reproduction of native bird species, so Egyptian Sacred Ibis needs to be monitored. It is also needed to remove Egyptian Sacred Ibis gradually, reducing their threat.
## Definition and Calculation
* The data from 1995 to 2010 came from the subsidy project of the Chinese Wild Bird Society and the Forest Bureau— The impact of invasive Egyptian Sacred Ibis on native birds in Taiwan, 2009. In order to compare year by year, the data was standardized to represent the population of Egyptian Sacred Ibis of the year by summation the maximum population of each county in the year.
* Due to the lack of relevant plans for reference from 2011 to 2014, it is based on the eBird records. After removing missing or unreasonable records of the data, the Egyptian Sacred Ibis population of the year is represented by summation of the maximum population of each county in the year.
* The data from 2015 to 2017 are from the 2015 -2017 African Sacred Ibis management pilot project of Forestry Bureau. The survey of the pilot project is synchronously conducted on the last weekend of each month from August to November. The area searching has been using in every possible region such as the western coastal regions and wetlands that African Sacred Ibis may distribute. The population size of each year would be estimated after collecting the survey data of each county and city.
* The data from 2018 are from the 2018 Population Control for Invasive Species-The Sacred Ibis annual report of Foersty and eBird records. The population size of African Sacred Ibis is represented by the sum of the maximum population size of every county and city (after removing the missing and unreliable records from eBird) and the number of eggs, juvenile, subadult, and adults removed in the report.
## The data and temporal range
The population size of African Sacred Ibis from 1995 to 2017. The locations and sizes of African Sacred Ibis from 1996 to 2018.
## Updates
There was no population size estimation in 2018 due to the survey only removed individuals and didn't record the population size. Therefore, the population size data were all from eBird. According to the data from January to December 2018, there were 3,544 records, and Tainan had the highest records, 295 individuals, among all counties and cities. Also, there was a reproductive control program for African Sacred Ibis in the same year. A total of 311 eggs, 216 juveniles, 200 subadults, and three adults had been removed.
## Trends
From the indicator trend, it can be seen that the distribution range and number of African Sacred Ibis has increased year by year. After 2005,  African Sacred Ibis has shown exponential growth, indicating that the threat of it has become more and more serious. In the 2017 Research Report of the Forestry Bureau, it was pointed out that the current population size of  African Sacred Ibis has threatened the survival of native bird species. The reason for the decline in population size from 2011 to 2014 is the data bias, which does not mean that the population size is reduced. The bias is because eBird was officially promoted in Taiwan in 2013. Therefore, the data from 2011 to 2012 is less and the error Larger. After promotion, many bird watchers have imported the data into the eBird database, and the number of Egyptian holy warriors obtained is highly reliable. At present, the Egyptian sages are distributed in the coastal areas of Taiwan's counties and cities, gradually spreading from the central north to the south, and there have been many observation records in the south. It is recommended that relevant units take a more active approach and directly control the number of ethnic groups in the holy ring of Egypt.
