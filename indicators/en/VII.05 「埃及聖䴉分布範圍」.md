### Brief Description
Since the first recorded sighting of African sacred ibis in 1984, its population has increased rapidly, posing a threat to native bird species. This indicator aims is designed to monitor the establishment and growth of alien bird populations in the wild, in order to reduce the potential negarice impacts on native species.

### Themes
Invasive species
### PSBR Model Type
Pressure (P)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41050 Prevention of invasive species:
1. Develop an emergency eradication plan for new invasive species and conduct regular drills with local governments.
2. Establish a long-term control plan for invasive species to minimize the economic loss and ecological impact caused by invasive species.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Number of existing invasive species, affected areas, and eradication cases handled/executed in the invasive species control plan.
* The reduction rate of distribution range/number of existing invasive species. The reduction in the number of individuals of existing invasive species.
### Background
The African sacred ibis, native to Africa and the Middle East, was first recorded in the wild in Guandu, Taipei, in 1984. It has since spread widely across the western coastal wetlands of Taiwan. Due to its high environmental adaptability and broad diet, the African sacred ibis competes with native Ardeidae species for key ecological resources such as food and nesting trees. This results in competitive exclusion pressures that may impact the survival and reproduction of native birds. It is therefore essential to monitor changes in the population size of the African sacred ibis and implement gradual removal measures to reduce its ecological threat.
### Definition and Calculation
* The data of 1995-2010 came from the project of the Taiwan Wild Bird Federation sponsored by the Forest Bureau— The impact of invasive Egyptian Sacred Ibis on native birds in Taiwan, 2009. In order to compare the data year to year, the data was standardized: the summation of the maximum population numbers from each county and city in a certain year is used to represent the population of Egyptian Sacred Ibis of that year.
* Due to the lack of relevant project as the reference from 2011 to 2014, the data is based on the eBird records. After removing missing or unreasonable records of the data, the Egyptian Sacred Ibis population of the year is represented by the summation of the maximum population of each county and city in the year.
* The data of 2015-2017 is from the African Sacred Ibis management pilot project of Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture (2015 -2017). The surveys of the pilot project are synchronously conducted on the last weekend of each month from each August to November. In the western coastal regions and wetlands, bird-watching societies in different locations conducted synchronized surveys using the method of area searching in locations where the African Sacred Ibis are likely observed. The population size of each year was then estimated after collecting the survey data of each county and city.
* The data from 2018 to 2021 were sourced from the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency's Project Reports on "Population Control for Invasive Species – The Sacred Ibis" and observation records of from eBird. Missing values and unreasonable records were removed. The annual population size was estimated by summing the maximum number of individuals reported by each local government, substrcting the number of the removed of eggs, chick, subadults, and adults.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
The population size of African Sacred Ibis from 1995 to 2021. <br> The locations and population size of African Sacred Ibis from 1996 to 2019.
### Updates
There was no population size survey in 2018; only individual removal removal were carried out. Therefore, all population data for that year were sourced from eBird. According to records from January to December 2018, a total of 3,544 records were submitted, with Tainan City having the highest number, 295 individuals, among all counties/cities. In the same year, a reproductive control program for the African sacred ibis was implemented, resulting in the removal of 311 eggs, 216 nestlings, 200 juveniles, and 3 adults.
### Trends
The trend chart shows that both the spatial range and population size of the African sacred ibis have been increasing steadily over years, with an exponential growth observed after 2005, indicating a growing ecological threat. According to a 2017 report by Forestry Bureau (now Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency), the population size of ibis has reaching a level that threatens the survival of native bird species. During the survey period, the apparent decline in population between 2011 and 2014 is attributed to data error and should not be interpreted as an actual population decrease. This discrepancy is deu to the insufficient and inconsistant data prior to the offical introduction of the eBrid platform in Taiwan in 2013. Following active promotrion of eBird, a significant number of birdwatchers began contributing their observations, greatly improving the credibility of ibis population estimate. Since 2019, the Forestry Bureau comissioned professional teams and indigenous hunters to assist in the removal of eggs, nestlings, juveniles and adults. In 2020, the removal team was expanded, and additional subsidies were provided to local governments for egg and nestling removal, as well as for collecting and reporting public sightings through eBird. These intensified efforts may explain the elevated population estimates in 2019 and 2020.
