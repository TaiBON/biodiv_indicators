### Brief Description
With limited resources and manpower, it is essential to establish an effective evaluation system to determine the prioritization of prevention and management strategies for various invasive alien species.

### Themes
Invasive species
### PSBR Model Type
Response (R)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D41060:
1. Establish a domestic list of alien and invasive organisms to analyze their ecological, economic hazards and management strategies.
2. Establish an international list of high-risk invasive species, study and analyze invasion pathways and prevention measures (no later than 2017, coordinate and make a list of alien invasive species, and include it in the control systems of customs, post office, the Coast Guard Administration and/or the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Council of Agriculture) (Report system and promotion and education to general public)
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Complete the list of domestic and international invasive species
* Complete the list of international high-risk invasive species (and use it for D41010)
### Background
Since invasive species pose different levels of threat to the local ecosystems, it is necessary to establish a risk assessment mechanism to classify invasive alien species as "priority management and prevention", "continuous monitoring" and "to-be-observed-and-assessed", etc., and to create corresponding monitoring and prevention measures.
### Definition and Calculation
Carry out a risk assessment on foreign invasive species, and establish a list of invasive species based on the risk level, which includes categories of "priority management and prevention", "continuous monitoring" and "to-be-observed-and-assessed". Conduct risk assessments of invasive species on items like "invasion history", "ecological adaptability", "life cycle", and "harmful traits", and adjust the assessment items according to different species. Those with high risk are given five points; those with medium risk or unknown status are given three points; those with low risk are given one point. Based on the risk score, a list of invasive species is established in the categories of "priority management and prevention", "continuous monitoring" and "to-be-observed-and-assessed".
### Data Coverage and Time Span
List of Invasive Alien Species Risk Assessed and Categorized (2004)<br> List of Invasive Alien Species Pending Management Assessment (2020)
### Updates
In 2004, a “List of 21 Invasive Alien Species under Priority Control, Long-term Management, Observation, Monitoring, and Evaluation” was published, which included the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) and bitter vine (Mikania micrantha). Between 2020 and 2022, based on the project “Establishment of the Assessment System and Checklist for Specific Invasive Species in Taiwan,” a total of 43 invasive alien species identified by relevant agencies will be included for management assessment. As of now, 19 of these species have been evaluated.
### Trends
(Currently, only the 2004 the "List of 21 invasive alien species under priority control, long-term management, observation, monitoring, or evaluation" is available. This list was not updated through 2018. In 2020, it was revised to include 43 invasive alien species, for which the assessments and management plannings are still pending.)
