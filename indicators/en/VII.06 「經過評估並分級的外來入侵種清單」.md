## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment. Biodiversity Action Plan: D41060
1. Establish a domestic list of alien and invasive organisms to analyze ecological, economic hazards and management strategies.
2. Establish an international list of high-risk invasive species, study and analyze invasion routes and prevention measures (no later than 2017, coordinate and arrange a list of alien invasive species, and include it in the control systems of customs, post office, the Coast Guard Administration and/or the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Council of Agriculture) (notification system and propaganda of public education)

Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Complete the list of domestic and international invasive species
* Complete the list of international high-risk invasive species (and use for D41010)
## Background
Since invasive species pose different levels of threat to the local ecosystems, it is necessary to establish a risk assessment mechanism to classify invasive alien species as "priority management and prevention", "continuous monitoring" and "to-be-observed evaluation", etc., and to create corresponding monitoring and prevention measures.
## Definition and Calculation
Carry out risk assessment of foreign invasive species, and establish a list of invasive species based on the risk level, which includes "priority management and prevention", "continuous monitoring" and "to-be-observed evaluation". Conduct risk assessments of invasive species through categories such as "invasion history", "ecological adaptability", "life cycle", and "harmful traits", and adjust the assessment items according to different species. Those with high risk are rated as five points; those with medium risk or unknown status are rated as three points; those with low risk are rated as one point. According to the risk score, a list of invasive species is established based on "priority management and prevention", "continuous monitoring" and "to-be-observed evaluation".
## The data and temporal range
List of introduced invasive species after risk assessment and classification (2004)
## Updates
In 2004, the “list of 21 invasive species in priority prevention, long-term management, observation, monitoring, or evaluation” was published, which included red fire ants, *Mikania micrantha*, etc. The list remained the original proposal until 2018 and has not been updated or deleted.
