### Brief Description
Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, playing vital ecological roles and holding significant values. Their rich biodiversity makes them an important biological gene bank, serving as a platform for the evolution of new species and providing critical habitats for the survival and reproduction of various organisms.

In addition to economic production, water retention and flood mitigation, water purification, coastal stabilization, tourism and recreation, research, and education, wetlands play a key role in providing habitats for organisms and platforms for species evolution, stabilizing ecosystems, and preserving biodiversity and genetic resources. These functions highlight wetlands' substantial economic and ecological values, which are in line with the goals of the sustainable development.

#### SDGs
6.6 By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D21020 <br> Complete the plan of monitoring system on terrestrial, wetland and marine biodiversity, including the confirmation of monitoring places and methods
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Finalize the planning of monitoring location and method for national biodiversity
### Background
Wetlands have benefits such as water retention and flood suppression, water purification, economic production, recreation, research, and education. They also provide habitats for a variety of living organisms, which are important gene pools. Therefore, wetland plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity, conserving species genes, and stabilizing the ecosystem. To enhance the conservation and restoration of wetlands, zero net losses of wetlands should be ensured.
### Definition and Calculation
The development and utilization of wetland resources are subject to mitigation, *ex situ* compensation, or ecological compensation measures to ensure no net loss of wetland area or ecological function. Since the implementation of the Wetland Conservation Act in 2015, the total area of Taiwan’s Wetlands of Importance was recorded at 41,894 hectares that year. This value serves as the baseline for assessing subsequent changes in the area of Taiwan’s Wetlands of Importance.
### Updates
According to the Urban and Rural Development Branch of the Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior, the total area of Taiwan's Wetlands of Importance reached 42,699 hectares as of the end of 2021.
### Trends
Following the implementation of the Wetland Conservation Act, the area of Taiwan’s Wetlands of Importance was recorded at 41,894 hectares in 2015. From 2015 to 2019, this figure remained stable. In 2021, the area increased slightly to 42,699 hectares compared to 2019.
