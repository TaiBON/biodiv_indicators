### SDGs
6.6 By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D21020 To complete the plan of terrestrial, wetland and marine biodiversity monitoring system, including confirmation of monitoring places and methods Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* To confirm the plan of national biodiversity monitoring places and methods
## Background
Wetlands have benefits such as water retention and flood suppression, water purification, economic production, recreation, research and education. They also provide habitats for a variety of living organisms, which are important gene pools. Therefore, the wetland plays a key role on biodiversity maintenance, conservation of genetic provenance and ecological stabilization. In order to enhance the conservation and restoration of wetlands, zero net losses of wetlands should be ensured.
## Definition and Calculation
The development and utilization of wetland resources, through measures such as impact mitigation, ex situ compensation or ecological compensation, made the area and ecological function of the wetland without loss. It has been implemented in conjunction with the Wetland Conservation Act since 2015. The national important wetland area was 43,546 ha, and use this as a basis to assess changes in the area of important national wetlands in the future.
## Updates
Important wetlands at national level remain 43,546 hectares during 2015–2018
## Trends
To cope with Wetland Conservation Act, the important wetland area in 2015 was 41,894 ha, and maintained at 41,894 ha from 2015 to 2018.
