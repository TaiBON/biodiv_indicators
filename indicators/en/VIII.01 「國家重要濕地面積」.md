### SDGs
6.6 By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D21020 Complete the planning of the monitoring system for land, wetland and marine biodiversity, including the determination of monitoring locations and methods Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Finalize the planning of monitoring location and method for national biodiversity
## Background
Wetlands have benefits such as water retention and flood suppression, water purification, economic production, recreation, research, and education. They also provide habitats for a variety of living organisms, which are important gene pools. Therefore, wetland plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity, conserving species genes, and stabilizing the ecosystem. To enhance the conservation and restoration of wetlands, zero net losses of wetlands should be ensured.
## Definition and Calculation
Through measures such as impact mitigation, *ex situ* compensation, or ecological compensation, we have maintained zero loss in the area and ecological function of wetlands, despite the development and utilization of wetland resources. These measures have been implemented in conjunction with the Wetland Conservation Act since 2015. The national important wetland area was 43,546 ha in 2015, which is used as the baseline to assess changes in the area of Taiwan's Wetlands of Importance in the future.
## Updates
The area of Taiwan's Wetlands of Importance remains 43,546 hectares during 2015–2018
## Trends
The area of Taiwan's Wetlands of Importance in 2015 was 41,894 hectares. Because of the implementation of the Wetland Conservation Law, the above area remains the same from 2015 to 2018.
