## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11050 According to the design concept of conservation axis of Central Mountain Ranges, the coastal conservation zone is planning to set, and resolves the existing conflict between the coastal conservation and development. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Completion of national coastal conservation zone planning
* The area ratio of protected natural coastal zone to the total coastal zone in Taiwan
* Identify potential locations for protection and development conflicts
## Background
Natural coasts provide habitats for marine life, the higher the natural habitats, the higher the stability of the ecosystem. In order to preserve the integrity of ecological functions of coast, Ministry of the Interior uses satellite image or aerial photos to monitor the coastaline every year based on "sustainable coastal development program", and to control the changes in natural and artificial coastlines.
## Definition and Calculation
Those who construct artificial facilities in the coastal areas, such as embankments, ports, tetrapods, tideland, and drainage channels, belong to the artificial coast, and the portion deducted from the artificial coast is the natural coast. Proportion of natural coastline = total length of natural coastline / total length of coastline
## The data and temporal range
Changes in natural and artificial coastlines over the years (2008–2018)
## Updates
The proportion of natural coasts in 2018 is the same as that in 2017, both at 55.32%.
## Trends
With the increase in the length of artificial coastlines such as embankments, wave blocks, ports, etc., the length of natural coastlines has decreased year by year. From 2008 to 2018, the proportion of natural coastlines decreased from 56.18% to 55.32%.
