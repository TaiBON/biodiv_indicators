## Corresponding targets
### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11050 Follow the concept of the Central Mountain Conservation Axis to designate a belt of coastal protected areas, resolving the conflicts between protecting and exploiting existing coastal areas. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Complete the planning of national coastal conservation belt.
* The area ratio of protected natural coastal belt to the total coastal belt in Taiwan
* Identify potential locations for protection-development conflicts
## Background
Natural coasts provide habitats for marine life, the higher the ratio of natural habitats, the higher the stability of the ecosystem. To preserve the integrity of ecological functions of the coast, the Ministry of the Interior uses satellite image or aerial photos to monitor the coastline every year based on the "Sustainable Coastal Development Program", and to oversee the changes in natural and artificial coastlines.
## Definition and Calculation
The coastal areas with artificial constructions, such as embankments, ports, tetrapods, tideland, and drainage channels, belong to artificial coast. After substract the portion of artificial coasts, the portion of natural coast is obtained. Ratio of natural coastline = total length of natural coastline/ total length of coastline
## The data and temporal range
Changes in natural and artificial coastlines over the years (2008–2018)
## Updates
The ratio of natural coasts in 2018 is the same as that in 2017; both were 55.32%.
## Trends
With the increase in the length of artificial coastlines with constructions such as embankments, tetrapods, ports, etc., the length of natural coastlines has decreased year by year. From 2008 to 2018, the ratio of natural coastlines decreased from 56.18% to 55.32%.
