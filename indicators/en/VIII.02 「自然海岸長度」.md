### Brief Description
The Ministry of the Interior conducts annual coastline monitoring utilizing satellite image data, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's approved "Overall Development Plan for Sustainable Coast," which aims to maintain the proportion of natural coastline without further decline.

### Themes
Sensitive habitats
### PSBR Model Type
Response (R)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D11050 Follow the concept of the Central Mountain Conservation Axis to designate a belt of coastal protected areas, resolving the conflicts between protecting and exploiting existing coastal areas.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Complete the planning of national coastal conservation belt.
* The area ratio of protected natural coastal belt to the total coastal belt in Taiwan
* Identify potential locations for protection-development conflicts
### Background
Natural coasts provide habitats for marine life, the higher the ratio of natural habitats, the higher the stability of the ecosystem. To preserve the integrity of ecological functions of the coast, the Ministry of the Interior uses satellite image or aerial photos to monitor the coastline every year based on the "Sustainable Coastal Development Program", and to oversee the changes in natural and artificial coastlines.
### Definition and Calculation
Coastal areas with artificial structures, such as embankments, ports, tetrapods, reclaimed tideland, and drainage channels, belong to artificial coast. By substracting the length of artificial coastlines, the extent of natural coast is determined. <br> Ratio of natural coastline = Total length of natural coastline / Total length of coastline
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Changes in natural and artificial coastlines over the years (2008–2021)
### Updates
According to the Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior, the length of natural coastline in 2021 was 1,104.69 km, representing a slight decrease from 1,104.73 km in 2020.
### Trends
The decline in natural coastline length is primary attributed to coastal development in the northern and western Taiwan, as well as port and wharf construction in Kinmen. From 2010 and 2011, the length of natural coastline decreased by 2.37 km, from 1,101.33 km to 1,098.96 km. A further decrease of 0.84km occurred between 2013 and 2014, from 1,098.47 to 1097.63 km. <br> The increase of natural coastline is mainly due to the removal of artificial structures and the renewed digitalization of coastline. From 2016 to 2017, the length increased by 2.26 km, from 1,097.62 km to 1,099.88 km. <br> Owing to the variations in satellite image quality, tidal the fluctuations, and re-digitalization process, minor errors may exist in the data; however, the margin of error has been controlled within 2%.
