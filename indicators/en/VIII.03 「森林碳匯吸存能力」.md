### SDGs
15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 percent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D00008 Establishment of forest coverage area (normalized differential vegetation index; NDVI) and assessment of forest health monitoring. Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Estimation of forest coverage area in Taiwan
* The ratio of forest cover area to national forest area in the project of forest health monitoring and evaluation
## Background
Forest carbon sink is the total amount of carbon dioxide removed by forests per unit time. In 1997, the United Nations Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) included land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) into the guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, Among them, LULUCF estimates carbon emissions and carbon removals caused by changes in land use, forest and other woody biomass accumulations after 1990. The Regional Planning Act and the Forest Act have stipulated regulations for forestry land change and forest harvesting, and the ban on logging of natural forests has been implemented since 1992, and there are very few cases where forest land is changed to other uses. Therefore, we can used the forest types of the third and fourth national forest resources survey results conducted by Forestry Bureau, as well as forestry statistics on annual new planting, harvesting, fuelwood harvesting, and disturbances, etc., to estimate the annual carbon dioxide removal from Taiwan’s forest resources. Forest carbon sinks have attracted much attention because of their significant carbon sequestration and emission reduction effects and high non-carbon benefits. It has become one of the important methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions universally.
## Definition and Calculation
Changes in the total carbon dioxide removal of Taiwan's forest resources in each year. The forest carbon sequenstration inventory data can be estimated based on the results of the forestry statistics, the third and fourth national forest resource surveys conducted by the Forestry Bureau. The calculation is to estimate the increased stock volume of "forest remains forest" and "other land use type changes to forest", then multiply the activity data and deduct the the amount of forest area loss caused by disaster.
## The data and temporal range
Annual carbon dioxide removal of the overall forest resources in Taiwan (1990–2017)
## Trends
The estimation results show that the amount of carbon dioxide removal from forest resources in 2017 was 21.48 million metric tons, which is similar to the result in 2016. From 1990 to 2017, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from forest resources changed from 19 to 23.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The 1991 Tataka forest fire and the 2009 Morakot typhoon disaster caused a large amount of forest timber loss, resulting in decline of carbon dioxide removal by forest in 1991 and 2010. The other years are mostly stable.
