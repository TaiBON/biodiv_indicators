### Brief Description
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations incorporated Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) into the revised "IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories" in 1997, Under the LULUCF sector, carbon emissions and removals resulting from changes in land use, forests and other woody biomass stocks since 1990 are estimated.

Due to existing regulations under Taiwan’s Regional Planning Act and Forestry Act regarding land use changes and forest harvesting, and the implementation of a natural forest logging ban since 1992, land-use change from forest to other uses has been rare. Therefore, data from the Forestry Bureau’s Third Nationwide Forest Resources Inventory—including forest type area—and annual forestry statistics on afforestation, logging, fuelwood harvests, and disturbances can be used to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks. These changes serve as indicators for assessing the health of forest ecosystems (Environmental Protection Administration, 2016).

### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 percent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D00008 Establish forest cover data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and assessment and monitoring on forest health.
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan:
* Estimate the forest cover in Taiwan
* The ratio of forest cover under forest health monitoring and assessment to national forest cover
### Background
Forest carbon sequestration is the total amount of carbon dioxide removed by forests per unit of time. In 1997, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations included land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) into the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Carbon emissions and carbon removals caused by changes in land use, forest, and other woody biomass accumulations after 1990 were estimated in the guideline. The Spatial Planning Act and Forest Act in Taiwan have stipulated regulations for changes in forestry land and forest harvesting, and the ban on logging of natural forests has been implemented since 1992. As a result, there have been very few cases where forest land is changed to other uses. Therefore, we can use the forest area obtained in the Third& Fourth National Forest Resources Survey (conducted by Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture), as well as the forestry data on annual new planting, harvesting, fuelwood harvesting, and disturbances, etc., to estimate the annual carbon sequestration by Taiwan’s forest resources. Forest carbon sequestration has attracted much attention because of their significant ability of carbon sequestration and emission reduction and high non-carbon benefits. It has become one of the important methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions internationally.
### Definition and Method of Calculation
Changes in the total carbon dioxide removed by Taiwan's forest resources each year. The increased sequestration volume of "forest remains forest" and "other land use type changes to forests" can be estimated using the results of the Third& Fourth National Forest Resources Survey (conducted by Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture). The obtained volume is then multiplied by the activity data and deduct the amount of forest area loss caused by disasters, to estimate the forest carbon sequestration inventory.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Annual carbon dioxide removed by the overall forest resources in Taiwan (1990–2021)
### Trends
The estimation results show that the amount of carbon dioxide removed by forests in 2020 was 21.91 million metric tons, representing a difference of 11,830 metric tons compared to 2019. From 1990 to 2020, the overall carbon dioxide removal by forests decreased by 1.481 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent. Significant declines were observed in 1991 due to the Tataka forest fire. In 2001, a series of forest fires in Danda, Lishan, Xueshan East Peak, and Yangmingshan National Park—along with 59 minor fire incidents in other areas—contributed to reduced carbon sequestration. In 2009, Typhoon Morakot also caused substantial forest biomass loss, further decreasing carbon removal that year. Aside from these exceptional events, forest carbon removal remained relatively stable from 2010 to 2019.
