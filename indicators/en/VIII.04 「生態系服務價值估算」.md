### SDGs
15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 14: By 2020, provide important services such as water sources and ecosystems that contribute to health, livelihoods and well-being are secured and/or restored, including consideration of the needs of women, indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as the poor and vulnerable.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D31012 Consolidates information about the services, values, and benefits by local and indigenous communities provided by the ecosystem. Action plan key performance indicators:
* The total number and increase of relevant information in local communities
* Aboriginal traditional biodiversity survey
## Background
Ecosystems are closely related to human well-being, such as providing food, regulating climate, and sequestering dust. Whether directly or indirectly, tangible or intangible benefits are called "ecosystem services." In 2005, the "Millennium Ecosystem Assessment" proposed by the United Nations concluded the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being, and categorized ecosystem services into "supply services", "support services", "regulation services" and "cultural services". In 2007, the G8+5 Summit launched "The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)" initiative, and classified the above four categories into 14 items including "forest recreation" and "biodiversity and conservation”, “oxygen release”, “carbon sequestration, substitution of fossil fuels”, “prevention and control of surface collapse and land slide”, “water purification”, etc. The TEEB initiative expects the public would pay more attension on global economic benefits of biodiversity, the economic deficit caused by the loss of biodiversity, the impact of failure to take appropriate protective measures on biodiversity, and takes comprehensive evaluation and analysis of related issues. To consider Taiwan's ecological environment and current data status, "water purification", "carbon sequestration, alternative to fossil fuels" and "forest recreation" are included in the current preference of the 14 ecosystem services of TEEB initiative and proceed to estimate the values of ecosystem services.
## Definition and Calculation
Ecosystem service value refers to the evaluation of the benefits that humans can obtain from the ecosystem by price. After quantifying the intensity of ecosystem service activities, the evaluation method and price coefficient can be selected to evaluate the value of ecosystem services. To cope with the current situation in Taiwan, the value of the three forest ecosystem services of "purified water quality", "carbon sequestration, alternative of fossil fuel" and "forest recreation" is currently estimated first. Ecosystem evaluation must be within a fixed range of time and space, and different ecosystems have different estimation methods. The evaluation of ecosystem service functions must first define the scope and categories of "ecosystem services", and clearly define the functions that are ultimately used by humans, so as to avoid overlapping connotations of ecosystem service functions, which may result in double calculations in the evaluation.
* "Purified water quality". In Japan, the amount of water reserved per unit area of the forest can be obtained by subtracting evapotranspiration and surface runoff from the forest precipitation of different forest types and tree ages, and multiplying the area to obtain the total reserved water.
* 「固碳、化石燃料代替」中國是以單位面積森林淨生長重量乘上森林面積，得森林生產量乘上1.63得二氧化碳固定量，再乘上27.27%得樹木碳固定量，加上土壤碳固定量後計算森林二氧化碳的固定量，再以瑞典碳稅價格作為替代成本。
* In the UK, "forest recreation" is to calculate the expenses incurred in the natural environment and the expenses incurred during the visit, including fuel, public transport fees, entrance fees and parking fees.
