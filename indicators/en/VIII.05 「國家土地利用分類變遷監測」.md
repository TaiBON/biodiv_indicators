### Brief Description
Land use monitoring serves the purpose of promoting sustainable land use.

### Themes
Sensitive habitats
### PSBR Model Type
Response (R)
### Corresponding Targets
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 percent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
### Background
The national land-use monitoring is mainly composed of the detection system of land-use changes, the inspecting and reporting system of variation spots, the App for land monitoring and reporting, and the administrative procedures of the inspecting and reporting on variation spots. Its purpose is to use satellite remote sensing data to handle the operations of detecting land-use changes and inspecting and reporting on spots of variation, in order to understand the spatial and temporal trend of land-use changes, and adopt high-tech digital methods to improve the traditional methods of inspection and suppression on violation of land-use, to prevent illegal land destruction and achieve the goal of sustainable development of Taiwan.
### Definition and Calculation
Use satellite remote sensing as a detection tool to conduct comprehensive and periodic monitoring on land-use changes. First establish the spectral data of the satellite image sample area, complete the selection of permanent sample areas (the purpose of the permanent sample area is to provide a benchmark for the classification of remote sensing images, and it can be used to verify the results of image interpretation), and then observe the images of different periods to identify the differences. Use computer automated interpretation and manual screening to tease out spots of variation that are suspected as violations, and notify local governments and relevant authorities to send personnel to the sites to inspect and report the results of the inspection.
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Statistical Result of Changed Areas Report (2002-2022)
### Updates
In 2020, a total of 31,168 spots of variations were reported. Among them, 18,739 were determined to be legal upon inspection, 11,654 were found to be illegal, and 775 were classified as other cases, such as known construction, natural changes, unidentifiable locations, inaccessible for on-site inspection, or outside the jurisdiction. This represents an increase of 4,985 variation spots compared to 2020.
### Trends
Since 2014, the National Land Surveying and Mapping Center has taken over and integrated the monitoring projects previously conducted by the Construction and Planning Agency, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, and the Water Resources Agency. The monitoring frequency for each government department was increased to once every 2 months, and the resolution of satellite imagery was enhanced to 1.5 –2.5 meters. Compared to the pre-2014 period when monitoring efforts were not integrated, the detection rate of illegal land use has substantially improved since the implementation of the integrated monitoring system.
