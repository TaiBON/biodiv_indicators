### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 percent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
## Background
The national land-use monitoring is mainly composed of the detection system of land-use changes, the inspecting and reporting system of variation spots, the App for land monitoring and reporting, and the administrative procedures of the inspecting and reporting on variation spots. Its purpose is to use satellite remote sensing data to handle the operations of detecting land-use changes and inspecting and reporting on spots of variation, in order to understand the spatial and temporal trend of land-use changes, and adopt high-tech digital methods to improve the traditional methods of inspection and suppression on violation of land-use, to prevent illegal land destruction and achieve the goal of sustainable development of Taiwan.
## Definition and Calculation
Use satellite remote sensing as a detection tool to conduct comprehensive and periodic monitoring on land-use changes. First establish the spectral data of the satellite image sample area, complete the selection of permanent sample areas (the purpose of the permanent sample area is to provide a benchmark for the classification of remote sensing images, and it can be used to verify the results of image interpretation), and then observe the images of different periods to identify the differences. Use computer automated interpretation and manual screening to tease out spots of variation that are suspected as violations, and notify local governments and relevant authorities to send personnel to the sites to inspect and report the results of the inspection.
## The data and temporal range
監測通報回報統計成果(2002-2020年)
## Updates
依據國土利用監測計畫網站資料所示，2020年共回報26,008個變異點，其中有16,970個變異點經查驗後為合法、8,317個變異點屬於違規、721個變異點屬於其他(包含已知工程、自然變化、無法辨識變異點位置、無法現場查驗、不屬於其管轄範圍等)。相較2019年增加8,261個變異點。
## Trends
國土測繪中心自2014年接辦整合營建署、水保局及水利署等機關監測計畫，提高各機關監測頻率至每2個月1次，並將衛星影像解析度提升為1.5公尺至2.5公尺。相較於2014年前未整合監測的成果，2014年執行監測整合迄今，國土違規使用發現率有明顯提高。
