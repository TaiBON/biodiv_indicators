### Brief Description
Emphasize the ecological and flood prevention functions of natural riparian zones.

### Themes
Sensitive habitats
### PSBR Model Type
Status (S)
### Corresponding Targets
#### SDGs
6.6 By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
#### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
#### Biodiversity Action Plan
D42030 Develop reasonable restoration methods for various ecosystems year by year, and evaluate the effectiveness of natural ecological projects and the survey and monitoring of ecological resources (including rivers and coasts).
#### Key performance indicator of the action plan
* Number of restoration methods complying with ecological principles in various ecosystems or results of research and evaluation on practicality (of these methods)
* The ratio of cases that resulting in improved biodiversity to the total number of cases with a budget exceeding NTD$50 million, along with the growth rate of this ratio.
### Background
To provide water for human use and protect the safety of residents along the river, governments will build a variety of hydraulic structures (such as dikes and revetments, etc.) next to the riverbanks, but the unnatural hydraulic structures have poor permeability, which barely provides living spaces for organisms, and it will block many biological activities, causes the fragmentation of the riparian habitat, and affect the ecology of the riparian habitat.
### Definition and Calculation
According to the official statistical report "Current River Flooding Prevention Construction" compiled by the Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, the length of natural riverbanks is estimated by subtracting the length of hydraulic engineering structures (levees and revetments) from the total riverbank length. Each River Management Office and local government submits annual reports on the lengths of river mainstreams, levees, revetments, and related structure. However, the reported total length of river mainstreams only includes downstream main channels, excluding tributaries, mountain creeks and un anaged rivers. The reported lengths of levees and revetments cover mainstreams, tributaries and other downstream areas. Additionally, the reports do not distinguish between newly constructed and reconstructed levees and revetments. Therefore, the calculation was adjusted as follows: Length of natural riverbank = (Total length of river mainstream + Length of unmanaged rivers) – (Total length of newly constructed levees + Total length of newly constructed revetments)
### Data Coverage and Time Span
Existing river flood control facilities (2001-2021)
### Updates
Based on calculations using offical statistics from the Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, the legnth of natural riverbanks along downstream main channels was 1,276.6 km in 2021, representing a decrease of 3.79 km compared to 2020 and falling below 1,300 km. This figure excludes mountain creeks and other unmanaged rivers, and reflects a long-term downward trend in the total length of natural riverbanks.
### Trends
Due to the increasing length of levee and revetments, the length of natural riverbanks has been steadily decline over the years. From 2001 to 2021, the total length of natural riverbanks decreased by approximately 487.77 kilometers.
