### SDGs
6.6 By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D42030 Develop reasonable restoration methods for various ecosystems year by year, and evaluate the effectiveness of natural ecological projects and the survey and monitoring of ecological resources (including rivers and coasts). Action plan performance indicators:
* Number of restoration methods complying with ecological principles in various ecosystems or results of research and evaluation on practicality (of these methods)
* (Number of cases where biodiversity has been improved)/(Total number of projects with a funding of 50 million or more) and growth rate
## Background
To provide water for human use and protect the safety of residents along the river, governments will build a variety of water conservancy structures (such as dikes and revetments, etc.) next to the riverbanks, but the unnatural water conservancy structures have poor permeability, which barely provides living spaces for organisms, and it will block many biological activities, causes the fragmentation of the riparian habitat, and affect the ecology of the riparian habitat.
## Definition and Calculation
根據經濟部水利署彙整編製成「現有河川防洪設施」之公務統計報表，以河川總長度扣除水利工程設施(堤防及護岸合計)的長度，可得天然河岸之長度。各河川局及縣市政府每年填報所轄河川的幹流長度、堤防長度、護岸長度等資料。然而，報表中的河川總幹流長度為下游主河道的長度，不包含支流、野溪與未整治河川等。堤防及護岸長度包含下游主河道及支流等其他區域。此外，新建與復建的堤防及護岸長度也並無區分。因此，計算方式調整如下： 天然河岸長度=(河川總幹流長度+未整治河川項目)-(欣建堤防總長度+新建護岸總長度)
## The data and temporal range
Existing river flood control facilities (2001-2019)
## Updates
According to the official summation report of the Water Resource Agency, Minister of Economic Affairs, the length of natural riverbanks in the downstream of the mainstem in 2019 was 1,415.89 kilometers, a decrease of approximately 11.58 kilometers compared to 2018.
## Trends
Due to the continuous increase in the length of dikes and revetments, the length of natural riverbanks has decreased year by year. From 2001 to 2019, it decreased by about 348.48 kilometers.
