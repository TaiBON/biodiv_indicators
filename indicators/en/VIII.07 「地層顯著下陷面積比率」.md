### Brief Description
The land subsidence results in low-lying terrain that is more prone to flooding during rainfall. In coastal areas, prolonged water accumulation or seawater intrusion into aquifers can cause soil salinization and the loss of fertility. Land subsidence is an irreversible phenomenon. Since land subsidence is an irreversible phenomenon, the area of significant subsidence is defined as an evaluation indicator to reflect the efforts of various agencies in subsidence prevention and control.

### Background
The land subsidence makes the low-lying areas easier to flood when it rains, causes long-term accumulation of water in coastal areas or seawater intrusion into the aquifer which can lead to soil salinization and the loss of fertility, affecting the value and utilization of land. Land subsidence is an irreversible phenomenon. To highlight the efforts of various agencies to prevent and control land subsidence, the area of significant subsidence is defined as one of the evaluation indicators.
### Definition and Calculation
"Area of significant subsidence" is defined as the area where the subsidence rate exceeds 3cm/year in the benchmark survey data. Subtract the prior elevation of all the leveling rods in the surveying area from the current elevation to obtain the subsidence value and then use the interpolation method to draw the subsidence rate contour map, and use the GIS to calculate the area of the zone within the contours exceeding 3cm/year (the surveying error of benchmark leveling loop is 2cm).
### Updates
According to land subsidence data from the Water Resources Agency, the area of significant land subsidence in 2021 was approximately 668.8 km², accounting for about 1.9% of Taiwan’s main island. Compared to 2020, the subsidence area increased by approximately 583.2 km², accounted for 1.62% of the island.
### Trends
Due to the government's active efforts in subsidence prevention, the rate of subsidence in affected areas has slowed in recent years. The area of significant land subsidence across Taiwan decreased from 1,529.2 km<sup>2</sup> (4.23%) in 2001 to 395 km<sup>2</sup> in 2017 (1.09%). However, during 2014 and 2015, unfavorable water conditions led to a lower groundwater recharge than the sum of groundwater extraction and evaporation. As a results, the severity of land subsidence in Yulin increased, and the proportion of significant subsidence are rose during the two years.
