### SDGs
15.3 By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
### Biodiversity Action Plan
D42010 Investigate the location, area, and scope of the existing degraded ecosystems before 2015, and formulate countermeasures to restore the degraded ecosystems. Action plan performance indicators (the gray background means non-quantitative indicators):
* Each agency plans the priority order and methods of restoration of various degraded environments
* Restore various degraded environments or areas
## Background
The land subsidence makes the ground low-lying vulnerable to rain and flooding; long-term accumulation of water in coastal areas or seawater intrusion into the groundwater aquifer can easily salinize the land and lead to the loss of land fertility, which affects the value and utilization of the land. Land subsidence is an irreversible phenomenon, in order to highlight the efforts of various agencies to prevent and control land subsidence, the area of significant subsidence is defined as one of the evaluation indicators.
## Definition and Calculation
"Significant subsidence area" is defined as the area where the annual subsidence rate exceeds 3 cm in the detection data of bench mark. Subtract the prior elevation of all the leveling piles in the detection area to obtain the leveling pile subsidence, and then use the interpolation method to draw the subsidence rate contour map, and use the GIS to calculate the area of the equivalent area of the level exceeding 3 cm (the error of bench mark closed inspection is 2 cm).
## Updates
In 2018, the significant land subsidence area was 419.6 square kilometers (1.17%). Compared with 2017, this is an increase of 0.07%.
## Trends
As the government aggresively promotes the prevention and control of land subsidence, the continuous subsidence rate in land subsidence areas has tended to moderate in recent years. The area of significant land subsidence across Taiwan has decreased from 1,539.1 km<sup>2</sup> (4.27%) in 2001 to 395 km<sup>2</sup> (1.10%) in 2017. However, in 2014 and 2015, due to poor precipitation conditions, the amount of groundwater recharge was less than the amount of groundwater used and evaporation, which caused a more serious land subsidence in the Yunlin area, resulting in an increase in the significant land subsidence area ratio.
