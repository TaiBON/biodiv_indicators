### SDGs
15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. 15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. 15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
目標15： 到2020年，透過保育和復原行動，包括復原至少15 %退化的生態系，強化生態系的復原能力以及生物多樣性對碳吸存的貢獻，從而幫助減緩與調適氣候變遷及防止沙漠化。
## Background
生物多樣性的喪失導因自許多因素，諸如氣候變遷、外來種入侵與污染，不過世界保育聯盟(IUCN, The World Conservation Union)在1994年與2004年相隔十年發表的瀕危物種紅皮書中，都將「棲地喪失」列為降低生物多樣性的最大原因，因此生態保育需要做好棲地保護以維護棲地多樣性。
## Definition and Calculation
Habitat diversity is the assessment of habitat health, which provides a set of "attribute indicators" for assessing the health status of species in each designated area. Taking the assessment of forest land health as an example, the monitoring methods for attribute indicators, including tree species diversity and the renewal monitoring methods will be used or not would according to different species. The fieldwork is used to investigate the habitat range, species composition, and species population to assess the health status, and giving seven levels:
| Level | description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|       |             |
 Favourable Maintained|Achieved the monitoring target Favourable Recovered|The nature conservation feature that was previously rated as "poor", now the condition has been restored to good condition, and the monitoring target has been successfully achieved Unfavourable Recovering|One Many attribute indicators fail to reach the target, but there are management measures to improve this situation Unfavourable No Change|One or more attribute indicators fail to reach the target, and there is no improvement measure Unfavourable and continuous Unfavourable Declining|One or more attribute indicators fail to reach the target, and if you don’t take action in time, your health will get worse and worse. Partially Destroyed|Some natural features in the area disappear, and there is no The first line of life for restoration Totally Destroyed|The natural features in the area have completely disappeared and cannot be restored
