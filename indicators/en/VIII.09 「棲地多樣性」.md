### SDGs
15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. 15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. 15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.
### Aichi Biodiversity Targets
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
## Background
The loss of biodiversity is due to many factors, such as climate change, alien species invasion and pollution. However, the Red Book of Endangered Species published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1994 and 2004, the "habitat loss" is listed as the major reason for reducing biodiversity. Therefore, conservation requires habitat protection to maintain habitat diversity.
## Definition and Calculation
Habitat diversity is the assessment of habitat health, which provides a set of "attribute indicators" for assessing the health status of species in each designated area. Taking the assessment of forest land health as an example, the monitoring methods for attribute indicators, including tree species diversity and the renewal monitoring methods will be used or not would according to different species. The fieldwork is used to investigate the habitat range, species composition, and species population to assess the health status, and giving seven levels:
| Level | description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|       |             |
 Favourable Maintained|Achieved the monitoring target Favourable Recovered|The nature conservation feature that was previously rated as "poor", now the condition has been restored to good condition, and the monitoring target has been successfully achieved Unfavourable Recovering|One Many attribute indicators fail to reach the target, but there are management measures to improve this situation Unfavourable No Change|One or more attribute indicators fail to reach the target, and there is no improvement measure Unfavourable and continuous Unfavourable Declining|One or more attribute indicators fail to reach the target, and if you donâ€™t take action in time, your health will get worse and worse. Partially Destroyed|Some natural features in the area disappear, and there is no The first line of life for restoration Totally Destroyed|The natural features in the area have completely disappeared and cannot be restored
