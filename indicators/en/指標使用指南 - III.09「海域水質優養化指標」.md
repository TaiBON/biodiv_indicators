## Introduction

- **Purpose**: By integrating marine water quality data, this indicator aims to quantify the level of eutrophication of marine water, thereby providing support for marine pollution prevention and control policies.
- **Background**: Global water pollution is becoming increasingly severe, and marine eutrophication poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems.This indicator uses the Eutrophication Index (EI) to assess the water quality of Taiwan’s coastal marine areas, in support of the goal of reducing marine pollution.

## Definition of the Indicator

- **Definition**: The eutrophication index (EI) of marine water quality uses the concentration of chlorophyll-a of phytoplankton, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and orthophosphate as main parameters to comprehensively evaluate the level of eutrophication of coastal waters.
- **Target and reference standards**: This indicator corresponds to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.1, Aichi Target 8, aiming for a water quality compliance rate of over 99.5% by 2020.

## Methodology of Indicator Calculation

**Formula**:

The eutrophication Index (EI) is calculated based on the following 5 parameters:

EI = 0.279 × ([PO₄³⁻] / 31) × 1000 + 0.261 × ([NO₃⁻] / 14) × 1000 + 0.296 × ( [NO₂⁻] / 14) × 1000 + 0.275 × ([NH₄⁺]/14) × 1000 + 0.261× [Chl-a]

Each parameter — nutrients (mmol m⁻³) and chlorophyll-a (mg m⁻³) — is calculated and weighted based on Taiwan’s water quality characteristics. These values are integrated into a single eutrophication index to facilitate long-term trend analysis.

- **Data Standard**: Annual marine water quality monitoring is conducted for the five parameters to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the indicator.
- **Data source**：The data for this project is compiled from the Marine Conservation Administration's "Marine Water Quality Monitoring" data.

## Interpretation of the Indicator

- **Meaning**: This indicator reflects the eutrophication level in coastal water quality.Excessive eutrophication can lead to overgrowth of phytoplankton, which in turn affects dissolved oxygen level and thus the health of marine organisms.
- **Ecosystem impact**: When the eutrophication level is too high, the occurrence of marine hypoxic zones will increase, leading to a decline in biodiversity.On the contrary, the low eutrophication level indicates good water quality, which is conducive to the stability of marine ecosystems.
- **Policy relevance**: This indicator corresponds to SDGs Target 14.1 and Aichi Target 8 and can provide data support for policymaking to control marine pollution and reduce nutrient and waste discharges.

## Policy Recommendations

- **How to interpret the indicator**: When the indicator shows an increase in eutrophication levels, it is recommended to strengthen pollution source control, including reducing nutrients in agricultural and urban runoff.If the eutrophication index remains elevated over time, necessary actions should be implemented to reduce pollution emission at the sources.
- **How to integrate the indicator into decision-making**: The eutrophication index should be considered alongside other water quality indicators, such as dissolved oxygen and pH levels, to provide a more comprehensive analysis for coastal pollution prevention and control.
